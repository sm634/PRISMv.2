But because many of them have left their husbands behind in Syria, they are vulnerable sexual violence and sexual exploitation.\n\nHumanitarian groups are working to tackle the problem, but complain that a lack of money to fund the effort prevents them from doing more to help these women and girls.\n\nAsmaa Donahue, an advisor with the International Rescue Committee (IRC), describes the challenges refugee women face once they cross the border:\n\n‚ÄúWhile the lack of security in camps makes them less safe for women, at least things like food and some supplies and services are available,‚Äù Donahue said. ‚ÄúA much larger proportion of refugees in this crisis are actually living outside camps in towns and villages, and don‚Äôt have access to many services at all.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMany are struggling to make ends meet, barely able to scrape together the monthly rent for overcrowded apartments, or squatting in abandoned buildings or makeshift camps. Many are not able to work legally and have no steady source of income,‚Äù Donahue said.\n\nAs a result, women resort to risky survival strategies such as early or forced marriage or exchanging sex for food and a place to live.\n\nExploit‚Äîor be exploited\n\nThe Zaatari refugee camp in northwestern Jordan has, by all reports, become a hub for quick marriages between Syrian women and men from other countries, particularly the Gulf area. Hamida Ghafour, a foreign affairs reporter for the Toronto Star, recently spent time at the camp for a report on the subject and describes it as ‚Äúa buyer‚Äôs market.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf you are a groom and you are looking for a bride, preying on Syrian women is easier because they are in a position of not having any bargaining rights in getting a mahr, a sort of dowry,‚Äù she said.\n\n(Note: In Islamic law, mahr, a requirement of marriage, is paid to the bride and is hers to spend or save as she wants. However, in some countries, it is paid to her family).\n\n‚ÄúA lot of these women don‚Äôt know what else to do with their daughters, because they don‚Äôt have a tradition like you see elsewhere in the Arab world. Girls don‚Äôt go out and live on their own, go to university or live a single life,‚Äù Ghafour said, ‚Äúso they have to get married, settle down.‚Äù\n\nSome men go to Jordan with the best of intentions, either out of a sense of religious duty or in search of a good wife, but because there is no way to investigate the backgrounds of prospective grooms and their families, families cannot be certain that their daughters will be treated well.\n\nThe phenomenon has created new business opportunities; Ghafour relates the story of ‚ÄúUm Majid,‚Äù a 28-year-old refugee from Homs who works as a marriage broker.\n\nIt began when a local aid organization approached her to ask if she knew any ‚Äúpretty girls,‚Äù Um Majid said. Most of her business is conducted through word of mouth. Sometimes, she admits, she goes into the Zaatari camp posing as an aid worker to scout potential brides for her clients. She expresses shame, but says life is all about survival‚Äîyou either exploit or be exploited.\n\nUnderage Marriages\n\nDominique Hyde, the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund representative in Jordan, says that while no official statistics are available, she confirms that UNICEF has seen an increase in early marriages to Jordanian, Egyptian and Gulf men. While early marriage‚Äîat the ages of 15 or 16‚Äîare not unusual in Arab society, particularly in rural areas, some refugee girls are being married off as early as 12 or 13.\n\n‚ÄúChild brides are at risk of violence, abuse and exploitation, and child marriage often results in separation from family and friends and lack of freedom to participate in community activities, which can have major consequences on girls‚Äô mental and physical well-being,‚Äù Hyde said.\n\nUNICEF is working with other U.N. partners in Jordan to explain to Syrian families the challenges of early marriages.\n\n‚ÄúObviously,‚Äù Hyde said, ‚Äúwe can advocate with parents, but the reality is that when they have no more resources, they sometimes see marriage as the only solution for their daughters.‚Äù\n\nMarriage ‚ÄúLite‚Äù\n\nOstensibly designed as a way to get around the high price of marriage and avoid the sin of adultery, the misyar ‚Äì or temporary‚Äîmarriage, legal only in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, allows a man and woman to have sexual relations even though they don‚Äôt live in the same home.\n\nNewspaper accounts back up statements by aid workers that traditionally, some wealthy Gulf men vacation in poorer countries such as Jordan or Syria, where they enter into misyar contracts for the duration of their holiday, then abandon their ‚Äòwives‚Äô when they return home.\n\nRefugee parents are approving such unions in the hopes that these temporary unions may someday lead to normal marriages. In reality, the endings are not so happy.\n\n‚ÄúThe girl goes off with the husband, and after a few weeks or a few months, the husband gets tired of his young bride and sends her back to her family,"" Ghafour told VOA. ""And there is nothing anyone can do about this, because the marriage is not legally registered with the Jordanian government, and so the girls, the families, don‚Äôt have any legal recourse.‚Äù\n\nThose who are abandoned by their misyar husbands return in disgrace and may be forced to turn to prostitution in order to survive.\n\nProstitution\n\nBecause of the special stigma attached to prostitution in the Middle East, it is difficult to get information about its prevalence in refugee communities. Humanitarian workers appear reluctant to admit that it takes place under their care. What can safely be said is that prostitution is a desperate measure taken by women who have no other means of support.\n\nThe Toronto Star‚Äôs Ghafour had the opportunity to sit down with a young woman who admitted to working as a prostitute. ‚ÄúShe was 15, actually, and she had gone through a misyar marriage. Essentially, that‚Äôs prostitution, isn‚Äôt it? She was too afraid to actually sit down and be interviewed, for natural reasons. She was worried for her life.‚Äù\n\nGhafour says that local community-based organizations are very wary of helping women who work as prostitutes. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt see it as a priority because there are so many negative connotations about it,‚Äù Ghafour said.\n\nInsufficient Funds\n\nAid groups say they are struggling to keep up with rapidly increasing demands for services.\n\n‚ÄúThe international donors and donor governments have only met a quarter of their funding commitments to this humanitarian crisis, and that commitment is already based on refugee estimates that were lower than what we‚Äôre currently seeing,‚Äù IRC‚Äôs Donahue said.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, nearly a quarter of a million of Syrian child refugees currently reside in Jordan. More than 2,000 refugees have streamed across the borders every day, and Hyde says she expects these numbers to more than double by July, and triple by December.\n\n‚ÄúThe humanitarian community was extremely generous to UNICEF Jordan in 2012,‚Äù Hyde said. ‚ÄúBut this year only 19% or about $12 million of the $57 million appeal for Jordan has been confirmed.‚Äù\n\nBoth groups say that unless they receive significant new funding, they will be forced to scale back on services drastically in the coming months.","Cecily HillearyApril 11, 2013Each day, hundreds of Syrian women straggle into Jordan, Egypt and other neighboring countries in search of security and a better life for themselves and their children.\nAs a result, women resort to risky survival strategies such as early or forced marriage or exchanging sex for food and a place to live.\nExploit‚Äîor be exploitedThe Zaatari refugee camp in northwestern Jordan has, by all reports, become a hub for quick marriages between Syrian women and men from other countries, particularly the Gulf area.\n‚ÄúA lot of these women don‚Äôt know what else to do with their daughters, because they don‚Äôt have a tradition like you see elsewhere in the Arab world.\nWhile early marriage‚Äîat the ages of 15 or 16‚Äîare not unusual in Arab society, particularly in rural areas, some refugee girls are being married off as early as 12 or 13.",Marriage,Humanitarian aid,Homs,Middle East,Article,Jordan,Egypt,Child Trafficking,Accommodation/Hotel/Motel

which is owned by the Saudi Armed Forces Office and believed to house its defence attach √© - on Tuesday night and removed two workers from the Philippines who are suspected to have been the 'victims of domestic servitude'.\n\n\n\nOne woman reportedly tried to flee by squeezing through a gap in the front gate as it was closing.\n\nThis house in McLean owned by the government of Saudi Arabia, was investigated by the U.S. Immigration and Customs (ICE) officials on a report of human trafficking\n\nAn ICE official says agents went to the home in McLean on Tuesday night and removed the two possible victims of domestic servitude\n\nScandals involving wealthy families treating foreign maids like slaves are common in the Arab peninsula, and human rights groups have campaigned for better treatment of domestic workers there following instances of physical abuse and rape.\n\nYet it is rare that western governments discover the same scandalous practices on their own doorsteps.\n\nImmigration officials said the investigation is not complete, and that the workers were removed to 'protect their safety if in fact the accusations turn out to be true' according to one report.\n\n\n\nIt is not yet clear if the women alerted authorities or if someone else called them in.\n\n\n\nFairfax County police were called in to help.\n\nA preferred residence of Congressmen, diplomats and high-earning government employees, McLean lies just across the Potomac from Washington, D.C., offering a fast commute for those whose day jobs take them into the city.\n\nICE spokesman Brandon Montgomery says if investigators get reasonable information or confirmation, they would 'rescue the individuals and begin a full investigation, not let them linger in potential abuse'.\n\n\n\nIf ICE officials do determine a crime has been committed, a possibility exists that no charges will be filed due to diplomatic immunity.\n\nRecent arms sales from the U.S. to the oil rich kingdom included one deal in 2011 which reached around ¬£40billion -

There can be few more striking examples of oppression than the phenomenon of modern-day slavery.\n\nOver a century after it was legally abolished in the US and the UK, slavery continues to flourish across the globe. The International Labour Organisation estimates that 20.9 million people are trapped in some form of forced labour, an industry which generates more than US$44 billion a year for those who profit from it. Slavery and human trafficking is estimated to be the third largest criminal industry in the world, outflanked only by arms and drug dealing.\n\nIn one way or another it is a crime that reaches into every community in every country in the world: from the products we buy to the people with whom we share our towns and cities; in the global north as well as the global south.\n\nWe are pleased to announce that over the next twelve months, the Guardian, in partnership with Humanity United, a US-based foundation dedicated to building peace and advancing freedom, will shine a light on the phenomenon of modern-day slavery.\n\nOur intention is to create a global forum that investigates both the root causes and potential solutions to modern slavery, elevates global public dialogue, builds alliances on the front lines, and spurs the public, policymakers and corporate leaders to action.\n\nWe'll be focusing on key debates, ranging from the role of markets in sustaining modern day slavery to the failure of states and justice systems in both the developed and developing worlds to tackle the issue effectively. Worldwide, thousands of organisations are engaged in the fight to stop modern-day slavery and we will highlight the work they do and try to discover what needs to be done to make that fight more successful. We hope to achieve this through a blend of comment, analysis, online discussions and offline events,\n\nThis project is a partnership with Humanity United. All our journalism remains independent of sponsorship and follows GNM's published editorial code. Any content produced by, or in partnership with our funding partners, will be clearly labeled.\n\nThe Guardian is committed to open journalism, recognising that the best understanding of the world is achieved when we collaborate, share knowledge, encourage debate, welcome challenge and harness the expertise of specialists and their communities. This approach will be particularly valuable in dealing with modern-day slavery, which is a complex issue, touching the lives of millions of people in countless communities from the richest cities to the poorest villages in the world.\n\nWe therefore hope that our readers will engage with this project, to discuss the role that slavery plays in today's world, and by doing so, help to bring it to an end.\n\nJo Confino is executive editor of the Guardian\n\nTo read more about sponsorship and editorial independence at the Guardian, see managing editor Elisabeth Ribbans' Comment is free blogpost.\n\nThis content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

5e8223df0dc171d3c93e71f6,http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/keeping-children-out-of-labour/article4681082.ece,Keeping children out of labour,"The economic vulnerabilities that confront households in the current sluggish recovery from the global meltdown are aggravating the fight against child labour, says the International Labour Organisation. Its latest report emphasises the need for universal coverage of at least a minimum level of social security to help some 215 million working children. Half that number is trapped in the worst forms of child labour ‚Äî work akin to slavery, debt bondage, child prostitution and hazardous occupations harmful to health and safety. To be sure, the number of child workers did drop by some 30 million in the last decade. But job losses in the adult population in the wake of the global financial crisis and shocks related to crop failure and recurrent freak weather patterns are threatening a reversal of recent gains. The report collates findings from various studies that establish a clear correlation between adverse macro-economic indicators and the recourse to child labour. Correspondingly, cash transfers are known to prove effective in reducing child labour in Asia and Latin America, subject to supply-side conditions such as the availability of education facilities. Similarly, in many African countries where parents have been lost to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, social protection measures such as health insurance, targeted at the elderly, ensure uninterrupted school attendance among children.\n\nIt is abundantly clear then that the elimination of child labour is predicated upon making progress on many fronts. Getting kids to go to school, a key priority that drove the abolition campaign a decade ago, is obviously a necessary but not sufficient condition for the eradication of child labour. Surely, there has been a surge in enrolments in recent years and there has even been some talk of devising ways to retain wards beyond primary school. But all of this presupposes a sound overall policy framework to be sustained over the long term. A scenario where as much as 75 per cent of the global population (more than 5 billion people) has no access to comprehensive social protection, as per ILO estimates, hardly inspires confidence in the capacity of countries to kick start the lives of millions. To make headway, governments must be prepared to spend more. A hugely influential 2010 study which claimed that public debt ratios in excess of 90 per cent of gross domestic product would automatically lead to a decline in growth has recently been exposed as relying on erroneous calculations, a fact conceded by its authors. Several governments that have so far persisted with crippling austerity measures to cut back on welfare spending, with severe socio-political ramifications, should reconsider their stance.","The economic vulnerabilities that confront households in the current sluggish recovery from the global meltdown are aggravating the fight against child labour, says the International Labour Organisation.\nHalf that number is trapped in the worst forms of child labour ‚Äî work akin to slavery, debt bondage, child prostitution and hazardous occupations harmful to health and safety.\nThe report collates findings from various studies that establish a clear correlation between adverse macro-economic indicators and the recourse to child labour.\nCorrespondingly, cash transfers are known to prove effective in reducing child labour in Asia and Latin America, subject to supply-side conditions such as the availability of education facilities.\nIt is abundantly clear then that the elimination of child labour is predicated upon making progress on many fronts.",Macroeconomics,Labour movement,Latin America,Asia,Article,,,Child Labour,Servitude

Nevertheless, the gang was able to get away with raping, abusing and selling them for sex over an eight-year period.\n\nOxfordshire County Council has apologised for its failure to protect the girls. But chief executive Ms Simons said that although the council ‚Äútake enormous responsibility for what's happened‚Äù, her ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù is that she will not resign.\n\nMs Simons said the council would be asking itself some ‚Äúvery hard questions‚Äù in the wake of the case, which involved girls as young as 11 being drugged and raped by members of one of Britain's biggest ever child sex gangs.\n\nMs Simons, who has been the council's chief executive since 2005, added: ‚ÄúThere is going to be an independent serious case review which will look at the actions of all the agencies concerned...

The 14-year-old girl was taken to a police station where photographs were taken of her injuries. But she later dropped her complaint after pleas from another girl who was seeing Karrar at the time.\n\nThames Valley Police has also admitted its failings, saying that it was too reliant on the victims coming forward. However, the arrests which were finally made came after police began to fully understand the nature of a crime, about which most forces are still in the early stages of learning.\n\nOfficers began to forge closer relationships with the victims and with social services and other agencies in order to uncover and disrupt the abuse, rather than just work on cases which came to them.\n\n‚ÄúWe have had to tread very, very carefully with the victims. You cannot build a relationship in a night, it takes months and months,‚Äù said Simon Morton, a former acting detective chief inspector with Thames Valley Police.\n\nHe added: ‚ÄúThey have been through extreme abuse, possibly the most traumatic thing a child can go through - some were 10 or 11 when they had only just stopped believing in the Easter Bunny.‚Äù\n\nClick here to watch videos of the defendants being interrogated by police","Victims of child sex exploitation are still being blamed for their own abuse by the people responsible for protecting them, the author of a major study into sex trafficking gangs has said.\nHer comments, which follow the convictions of seven members of the Oxford child sex gang, come as pressure mounts on the chief executive of Oxfordshire County Council Joanna Simons to resign over her organisation's failure to protect children in its care.\nNevertheless, the gang was able to get away with raping, abusing and selling them for sex over an eight-year period.\nOxfordshire County Council has apologised for its failure to protect the girls.\nBut chief executive Ms Simons said that although the council ‚Äútake enormous responsibility for what's happened‚Äù, her ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù is that she will not resign.",Rape,Oxfordshire,Rochdale,Britain,Article,"New York, United States","Rochdale, Borough of Rochdale, England, United Kingdom",Child Trafficking,Illicit Activities

Kote. These rehabilitation schools are managed by non-government organisations (NGOs) with assistance from national and State assistance.

The children remain in the schools for one year, after which they are admitted to classes in government schools.\n\nMost of the children were rescued by NGOs, says Mr. Basha. After going through various social and family problems, the children find themselves forced to work. ‚ÄúWe carry out hundreds of raids every month, but we end up with very few cases for want of proof,‚Äù he said.\n\nAccording to Mr. Basha, 10 children were rescued in 2010‚Äì11 and eight in 2011‚Äì12.

Mr. Basha felt that the drive against child labour would be more effective if the officers involved worked in close coordination.

The report finds that rates of early marriage are strikingly high (one-third are married as children), that restrictions on the mobility of women and girls limit their access to work and aid supplies, and that 83 per cent of Syrian refugees are unaware of services for survivors of violence, which are now limited.\n\nThe report, led by UN Women in partnership with the Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development and The Queen Zein Al-Sharaf Institute for Development (JOHUD/ ZENID), was commissioned by a joint UN task force, which also includes the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund (UNICEF), in addition to partner organizations Save the Children International, the International Rescue Committee, the Jordanian Women‚Äôs Union, and Un Ponte Per (UPP).\n\nAccording to UNHCR, more than 1.6 million Syrians have fled the country‚Äôs civil unrest since March 2011 and sought shelter in neighbouring countries, including 472,764 in Jordan (as of 3 June 2013) ‚Äì a number that is expected to double by year‚Äôs end.\n\nSince humanitarian relief was initially directed towards refugees based in the Za‚Äôatri refugee camp (now home to more than 100,000), UN Women decided to focus the assessment on other communities, where two-thirds of Syrian refugees are currently residing. It targeted urban refugees living in 11 out of Jordan‚Äôs 12 governorates (provinces). The findings are based on data collected through questionnaires distributed to 613 refugees including women, girls, boys and men from different households; 34 focus group discussions held in all regions; and 45 in-depth interviews with key informants, community leaders and service providers from all regions.\n\nThe report finds widespread child marriage ‚Äì more than 33 per cent of participants were married when they were still children, and half of all respondents believed that the normal age of marriage for girls is under 18. Many respondents also perceived that the marrying age has further decreased since their displacement to Jordan, as impoverished refugee families seek dowries and one less mouth to feed.\n\nFindings indicate that Syrian refugee women also face major challenges in accessing basic resources and specialized services due to their restricted ability to leave home without a male family member. This makes it harder for women to engage in economic activities, receive education, participate in social activities, or receive aid supplies. One-fifth of girls never even go outside their homes in Syria and displacement has made it even less likely.\n\nThe report concludes that the longer the situation of displacement is prolonged, the greater the likelihood of higher rates of child labour for boys and early marriage for girls.\n\nThe study also reveals the lack of specialized and confidential services available to Syrian women and children who are survivors of gender-based violence, such as psychosocial counseling and legal support, and a lack of knowledge about such services even when available, with an overwhelming 83 per cent of Syrian refugees unaware of any services for survivors in their community.\n\n‚ÄúWe both hope and believe that this [report] has revealed a 360-degree picture of where and why necessary services and information have failed to effectively reach their target audiences,‚Äù says Dr. Sameera Al-Tuwaijri, UN Women Regional Director for the Arab States, adding that she hopes it ‚Äúwill fuel our collaborative efforts towards meaningful gender equality in humanitarian action.‚Äù\n\nServices for survivors\n\nTo respond to the lack of services, a new joint programme is being launched today at an event in the refugee community of Zarqa, northeast of Amman. To be implemented by UN Women, UNFPA and UNICEF, in partnership with Jordan‚Äôs Ministry of Social Development (MOSD), Ministry of Health (MOH), Family Protection Department (FPD), and other relevant NGOs, the project aims to increase survivors‚Äô access to comprehensive, life-saving protection including health, psychosocial and legal services in three areas in Jordan (Mafraq, Irbid and Zarqa). It will include access to shelters, legal aid and case management, as well as to quality health services, including reproductive health services adapted to age and gender.\n\nThe study and this new project build on UN Women‚Äôs work with Syrian refugees in Jordan, including economic empowerment and protection initiatives which began in January of this year and are already reaching some 3,000 women and children. They include sexual and gender-based violence protection, information and psycho-social activities such as an abuse hotline which has been used by at least 2009 Syrian refugees, health-awareness sessions attended by 216 women in Madaba, Al-Hussein and Hittin Camps, and recreational activities involving 276 children.\n\nUN Women is also supporting vocational training and income-generating activities for urban Syrian refugee women in the Al-Hussein, Der-Allah, Hittin and Irbid camps, where at least 186 women have attended training courses in skills as diverse as computers, to soap-making and hair-dressing.

5e8225050dc171d3c93e72ac,http://reliefweb.int/report/world/q-child-marriage-and-violations-girls-rights-14-million-girls-marry-each-year-worldwide,Q & A: child marriage and violations of girls' rights - 14 million girls marry each year worldwide - World,"What is child marriage?\n\nChild marriages occur when one or both parties are under the age of eighteen. The emerging consensus of international human rights standards is that the minimum age of marriage should be set at 18. A minimum age of marriage along with enforcement of a prohibition on forced marriage (irrespective of the age of either party) aims to protect both girls and boys from child marriage, although the practice affects girls more frequently and often coincides with other rights violations; including but not limited to domestic violence and impeded access to reproductive health care and education.\n\nHow many girls are affected by child marriage?\n\nEvery year 14 million girls are married worldwide. One in seven girls in the developing world is married before her 15th birthday ‚Äì some as young as eight or nine. In 2010, over 67 million women ages 20-24 had been married as girls, and, if the trend continues, 142 million will be married by 2020.\n\nThe top twenty ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù of child marriage, or countries with the highest prevalence, are: Niger, Chad, Bangladesh, Guinea, Central African Republic, Mali, Guinea, Nepal, Mozambique, Uganda, Burkina Faso, India, Ethiopia, Liberia, Yemen, Cameroon, Eritrea, Malawi, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and Zambia.\n\nOver 40 countries globally have a prevalence of child marriage of 30 per cent or higher. Two out of five girls are married as children in South Asia and Central and West Africa. Most of these girls are poor, less-educated, and living in rural areas.\n\nAbuses associated with child marriage Child marriages violate many human rights; including to education, freedom from violence, reproductive rights, access to reproductive and sexual health care, employment, freedom of movement, and the right to consensual marriage. The testimonies of the children and women Human Rights Watch has interviewed illustrate the profoundly detrimental impact on their physical and mental well-being, and their ability to live free of violence.\n\nConsequences of child marriage have lasting effects beyond adolescence as they struggle with the health effects of getting pregnant too young and too often, their lack of education and economic independence, domestic violence, and marital rape.\n\nHealth-related consequences Child marriage directly threatens the health and well-being of girls: complications from pregnancy and childbirth are the main cause of death among adolescent girls aged 15-19 in developing countries. Girls aged 15 to 20 are twice as likely to die in childbirth as those in their 20s, and girls under the age of 15 are five times as likely to die.\n\nThese consequences are due largely to girls‚Äô physical immaturity where the pelvis and birth canal are not fully developed. Complications in labor are exacerbated where emergency obstetric services are scarce, as is the case in many societies where child marriage is prevalent.\n\nPregnancy for adolescent girls poses a serious risk of developing obstetric fistula, since their smaller pelvises make them prone to obstructed labor. Fistula leaves its victims with urine or fecal incontinence that causes infection, pain, and a bad smell.\n\nA child born to a girl under 18 has a 60 percent greater chance of dying in the first year of life than one born to a woman 19 and older.\n\nEducation-related consequences Child marriage frequently ends a girl‚Äôs education forever. Girls who marry young are often expected to take on responsibilities at home that are prioritized over attending school.\n\nA lack of education limits girls' choices and opportunities throughout their lives, not just when they are children. The price of this exclusion is often poverty. In Yemen, one girl who married at the age of 12 told Human Rights Watch:\n\nAll that I‚Äôm good for is to be a mother, and a home maker.... I‚Äôm illiterate. They didn‚Äôt teach us anything. If they did, at least I would have benefitted from something.\n\nWithout education, girls and adult women have fewer opportunities to financially provide for themselves and their families. Research shows how limited education may make girls and women more vulnerable to persistent poverty when their spouses die, abandon, or divorce them.\n\nViolence against married girls Married girls and young women between the ages of 15 and 19 with low levels of education are at a much greater risk of domestic and sexual violence from their spouses than older and more educated women. Research cites spousal age difference, typical of child marriage, as a significant risk factor associated with violence and sexual abuse against girls.\n\nMarital rape is common in South Sudan, although it is not recognized by law. One girl told us her husband raped her, aided by his brothers:\n\nI had refused to have sex with him, but he forced me. My brothers-in-law used to lock me up in the house during the day so that I don‚Äôt go anywhere, and so that I can have sex with him.\n\nAnother told Human Rights Watch that her husband physically, emotionally, and sexually abused her. She said:\n\nI had fibroids and was in a lot of pain. Sex was painful. If I told my husband I had pain, he would get out shouting that he was going to look for sex elsewhere because I had refused him. Sometimes he would have sex with me anyway.\n\nIn 2010, the case of Elham Mahdi Al-Assi, a 12-year-old girl in Yemen, caught international media attention when she died three days after she was married to a much older man. Her death was the result of severe bleeding caused by tears to her genital and anal area. Elham's mother told the Associated Press that her daughter had complained that her husband tied her up and raped her. This was after Elham‚Äôs mother warned her that failure to consummate the marriage would bring her family shame.\n\nNon-consensual sex can have especially devastating mental health consequences for young girls because they are at a formative stage of psychological development. Child brides also often face emotional abuse and discrimination in the homes of their husbands and in-laws. Confined to a home that may be removed from their hometown and familiar surroundings, they are isolated from friends and family.\n\nWhat happens when girls seek help after suffering violence in their marriage?\n\nInternational human rights standards recognize the right of women and girls to live free from physical, mental, and sexual violence. However, in many countries where child marriage is an accepted practice, governments also fail to criminalize domestic violence and marital rape. Girls in child marriages, already vulnerable due to their age and alienated due to their gender and low social status, are thus denied the protection from their governments they so greatly need.\n\nChild marriage is more prevalent in jurisdictions that generally offer fewer protections for women and girls. Yemen currently has no minimum age for marriage and girls of any age can and are being married. After her husband raped her, 11-year-old Reem al-Numeri in Yemen attempted to seek a divorce only to be told by the judge ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt divorce little girls.‚Äù\n\nWhere legal provisions do exist to protect girls from child marriage or related forms of violence, authorities often fail to enforce that protection or to prosecute perpetrators. Cases of domestic violence in Afghanistan show that many women and girls are afraid to seek help from justice or security departments because they fear further abuse or being forcibly returned home.\n\nRangina Y., married at the age of 13 in Afghanistan, explained her distrust for courts and judges. After running away from the physical and verbal abuse of her in-laws, she faced pressure from President Karzai, hostility from powerful members of parliament and extralegal arguments by the head of the Family Court to return to her husband. Rangina Y. told Human Rights Watch: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go back. I can‚Äôt go back. They want to kill me.‚Äù Failing to receive protection and enforcement of national marriage laws, women and girls in situations such as Rangina‚Äôs have little reason to trust the state or government to protect them.\n\nWhat happens when girls try to resist early marriage?\n\nGirls who refuse to accept or stay in forced marriages, or who elope because they want to marry someone not chosen or approved of by their families, are often at risk of violence, imprisonment, and in extreme cases, may be killed by their families or husbands.\n\nIn South Sudan, local women‚Äôs rights organizations pointed out to Human Rights Watch that society is generally tolerant of such punishment because the girl is seen as having gone against her family‚Äôs wishes and societal norms. As a result, perpetrators are rarely held to account, perpetuating a culture of violence against women in the country.\n\nOne South Sudanese girl, who married at 15, told Human Rights Watch that she was in year five of school and wanted to finish her education, but her uncles beat her and her mother to force her to marry a 75-year-old man:\n\nThis man went to my uncles and paid a dowry of 80 cows. I resisted the marriage. They threatened me. They said, ‚ÄúIf you want your siblings to be taken care of, you will marry this man.‚Äù I said he is too old for me. They said, ‚ÄúYou will marry this old man whether you like it or not because he has given us something to eat.‚Äù They beat me so badly. They also beat my mother because she was against the marriage.\n\nEleven girls Human Rights Watch spoke to in South Sudan said their families restricted their movements after they became engaged. One told Human Rights Watch:\n\nI am now confined at home. My family does not allow me to leave home because they think I will get another man‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt even go to the market anymore or see my friends.\n\nAnother problem in protecting victims of forced marriage and enabling them to access justice is lack of coordination between relevant government ministries. For example, in South Sudan, Human Rights Watch documented that there are no guidelines on how the authorities should handle these cases, and ministries respond to cases in an ad hoc manner, often without offering any real solutions to the girls who go to them for protection. In the end, their inefficiency helps perpetuate child marriages and related abuses against girls.\n\nWhat work has Human Rights Watch conducted on child marriage?\n\nHuman Rights Watch has cited cases of child marriage in Bangladesh, Chad, Egypt, India, Iraq, Kenya, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Uganda, and Uzbekistan, and interviewed women and girls who experienced child marriage in Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, Yemen, and most recently South Sudan, where we found that almost half of the girls 15-19 were married.\n\nHow does Human Rights Watch recommend we end the practice of child marriage?\n\nGovernments can mitigate some of the worst abuses linked to child marriage by:","Over 40 countries globally have a prevalence of child marriage of 30 per cent or higher.\nAbuses associated with child marriage Child marriages violate many human rights; including to education, freedom from violence, reproductive rights, access to reproductive and sexual health care, employment, freedom of movement, and the right to consensual marriage.\nEleven girls Human Rights Watch spoke to in South Sudan said their families restricted their movements after they became engaged.\nWhat work has Human Rights Watch conducted on child marriage?\nHow does Human Rights Watch recommend we end the practice of child marriage?",Marriage,Human rights,Egypt,Syria,Article,Chad,Syria,Child Sexual Exploitation,Child Marriage

The first time she timed herself running the mile at the start of her training in October 2012, she came in at 15 minutes. Two months later, she got her mile time down to eight minutes. Her best mile time is seven minutes, 12 seconds.\nWhen Rabago heard the statistics and a story from one woman from southeast Asia who was sold into sex trafficking in Europe for 18 years, she could not ignore the injustices.\n""It breaks my heart. I have broken down in tears. It's hard to put it into perspective for other people,"" Rabago said. ""Imagine the most beautiful, educated and kind woman stolen, drugged, beaten and raped for 18 years and then let free and imagine how they feel.""\nThe numbers can be hard to track. Lauren Ryan, program manager for anti-trafficking services for the International Institute of Minnesota, said the International Labor Organization estimates there are 20.9 million victims of sex and human trafficking throughout the world.\nRunFree estimates there are 27 million adults and 13 million children worldwide that are victims of human trafficking and approximately 75 to 80 percent of them are sold into sexual slavery and 80 percent are under the age of 24. Some are even as young as six years old. About 30,000 die each year from abuse, disease, torture and neglect.\nPart of the difficulty in identifying victims is that prostitution is illegal in some countries, including the U.S., so the women might not always be initially identified as sex slaves but thought of as prostitutes.\nLt. Bryon Fuerst of the Anoka County Sheriff's Office is heading up a new human trafficking task force between the sheriff's office and local police departments throughout the county to train officers how to look for and investigate this problem. He said police must interview prostitutes they arrest to determine if they were coerced and who did it.\nRyan said those victimized the most are runaway youth. Fuerst said the task force will work closely with school resource officers and homeless resource contacts inside schools and in the community, and rely on tips to learn about potential victims and perpetrators.\nThe six runners are coordinating with Venture Projects and RunFree to raise money to combat human trafficking in the southeast Asian countries of Burma and Thailand. Venture Expeditions is a Minneapolis-based nonprofit that organizes adventure-driven expeditions to raise awareness and funds for a variety of humanitarian causes.\nThe money will specifically go to The Just+Hope Campaign and Eden Women's Ministry.\nVenture Expeditions has shipped a million meals to people along the Burma-Thailand border who have been affected by the decades-long Burma Civil War.\nRabago said educating people over there about the dangers of human trafficking and how wrong it is must also continue to happen. Some fathers who need the money sell their daughters, so one way to shut down these camps is to give money to the family so they do not feel forced to sell their daughters to sex traffickers.\nNot an avid runner\nRabago said endurance, and not time, is the key when running an average of 17.7 miles over 13 days; two of those days will be 26-mile runs. The farthest she has run without taking a break is 20 miles.\nShe cut out sugar and a lot of fatty foods to give herself more energy, but a secret she learned from a friend was running long distances is mostly about having the right mind-set and pushing yourself even when you become exhausted.\n""It's a spiritual battle, emotional battle and physical battle you have to overcome,"" she said.\nRabago lived in Blaine from third grade through graduation. She earned her high school diploma two years early by the spring of 2009, but walked with her graduating class in 2011.\nShe grew up in a Christian home, but her dedication to her faith became stronger when she went to college, and she has been finding inspiration from Bible versus as she trains.\n""I feel like throughout my whole life, I've had so many trials and so many situations where I've been running and have fallen, but God has always been there to tell me to get up and finish the race,"" she said on her first video blog posted Nov. 20, 2012.\nTo find out more information or to donate, visit www.ventureexpeditions.org/page/run-free.\nEric Hagen is at\neric.hagen@ecm-inc.com","A former Blaine resident and current St. Cloud State University student will be joining five others in running 230.2 miles across Minnesota June 23 to July 5 to raise awareness of the problem of forced-labor and sex trafficking.\nKatelyn Rabago said she knew ""little to none"" about human trafficking prior to hearing about it from RunFree representatives organizing the run from Watertown, S.D., to Stillwater.\nRabago was not an avid runner when she decided to join this run across Minnesota.\nThe first time she timed herself running the mile at the start of her training in October 2012, she came in at 15 minutes.\nWhen Rabago heard the statistics and a story from one woman from southeast Asia who was sold into sex trafficking in Europe for 18 years, she could not ignore the injustices.\nIt's hard to put it into perspective for other people,"" Rabago said.\nLauren Ryan, program manager for anti-trafficking services for the International Institute of Minnesota, said the International Labor Organization estimates there are 20.9 million victims of sex and human trafficking throughout the world.\nRunFree estimates there are 27 million adults and 13 million children worldwide that are victims of human trafficking and approximately 75 to 80 percent of them are sold into sexual slavery and 80 percent are under the age of 24.\nLt.

Andrew M. Cuomo's plan to crack down on human trafficking, submitted to the state Legislature as part of his Women's Equality Act, comes as New York lags behind other states in attacking the problem.\n\nExperts say thousands of people are trafficked every year in New York -- as sex slaves or forced farm workers. Yet relatively few arrests are made, largely because of legal obstacles and the victims' fear of coming forward.\n\n""In New York, as far as human trafficking is concerned, we're where the domestic violence movement was 25 to 30 years ago,"" said Emily Amick, a lawyer with Sanctuary for New York Families, an advocacy group.\n\nCuomo's proposed legislation would toughen penalties, making trafficking a Class B felony -- a violent crime with a minimum sentence of 5 years. Offenders now face as little as a year in jail.\n\n""Governor Cuomo's legislation recognizes the incredible violence of human trafficking,"" Amick said.\n\nUnder the measure, sex slaves arrested in connection with prostitution could cite trafficking as a defense -- a move advocates believe could lead to more investigations of human slavery rings. Prosecutors would also no longer have to prove juveniles were coerced or tricked into slavery.\n\nThough experts say New York is a human trafficking hot spot, just 77 people were arrested last year, according to the state Department of Criminal Justice. California authorities made 599 arrests in the first half of 2012, statistics show.\n\nGet the Breaking News newsletter! Get the latest breaking news as it happens.

The governor wants the legislature to act before it adjourns Thursday.\n\nThe bills' fate, however, is uncertain because Cuomo's proposal includes an abortion bill opposed by conservatives, including Senate co-leader Dean Skelos (R-Rockville Centre).\n\nThe Senate has approved its own anti-trafficking bill. But the Assembly wants to strengthen the human trafficking laws that are among Cuomo's bills.\n\nMost victims U.S. citizens\n\nNew York City is a magnet for runaway teens and home to a large population of low-income and undereducated people, many of whom are immigrants. There's also convenient access to international airports.\n\nTrafficking is often viewed as purely an overseas problem. But that's not the case.\n\n""The greatest percentage of any nationality of our victims is U.S. citizens,"" said David Rogers, the FBI's human trafficking program manager. ""That is something most people don't understand.""\n\nStatistics are sparse because it's a hidden crime that occurs behind closed doors, or ensnares people who fear being reported to child care or immigration authorities.\n\nFollowing raids earlier this week, 11 owners or managers of 7-Eleven convenience stores on Long Island and Virginia are accused of exploiting workers living her illegally by forcing them to work long hours and confiscating their pay.\n\nAt least 11,268 trafficking survivors in the metropolitan area were in contact with private service providers from 2000 to 2010, according to a 2011 Hofstra University study.\n\nNearly 88 percent were women and almost 72 percent were trafficked for sex, with other victims forced into domestic or farm labor. More than half were younger than 18 and two-thirds were born in the United States, the study found.\n\nIn Nassau and Queens counties, an emerging trend is traffickers bringing in Asian women from other areas to local massage parlors, according to a federal prosecutor who requested anonymity. Those sex slave cases are tough to prosecute because many victims fear bringing dishonor on their families.\n\n""They'd rather be deported than have their family back home find out,"" the prosecutor said.\n\n'I tried to leave'\n\nMany victims won't talk to authorities because they're too traumatized. Others have been threatened with violence.\n\n""He knew exactly how to break me,"" said Kenya, whose four-year ordeal as a sex slave began when she was 18. She spoke recently during a conference call with Amick, her attorney.\n\nAmick said all of Kenya's related convictions were expunged June 10 in Manhattan.\n\nHer ordeal began, she said, when her father locked her out of their Queens home and she was taken in by a man she thought loved her. He turned out to be a pimp. Later, after being sold to another pimp, the teen said she was forced to have sex with men in hotels.\n\n""I tried to leave and he beat me with a bat,"" said Kenya, an alias she uses for protection.\n\nCurrently working as a waitress, she said she wants to become a social worker so that she can help other human trafficking survivors.\n\n""There are still a lot of girls out there who need my assistance,"" she said.","Yet relatively few arrests are made, largely because of legal obstacles and the victims' fear of coming forward.\n""Governor Cuomo's legislation recognizes the incredible violence of human trafficking,"" Amick said.\nThough experts say New York is a human trafficking hot spot, just 77 people were arrested last year, according to the state Department of Criminal Justice.\n""The greatest percentage of any nationality of our victims is U.S. citizens,"" said David Rogers, the FBI's human trafficking program manager.\nCurrently working as a waitress, she said she wants to become a social worker so that she can help other human trafficking survivors.",Slavery,Human trafficking,Manhattan,Nassau,Article,"New York City, New York, United States","Queens, Queens County, New York, United States",Child Trafficking,Illicit Activities

He said authorities had rescued 73 prostitution victims in 2011; 17 in 2012 and eight in 2013. There was also a high number of people being forced into labour in the fishery business, he said, adding that authorities had rescued 15 persons in 2011; 17 in 2012; and seven in 2013.\n\nProvincial Police Region 9 investigator Pol Maj-General Jeerawat Udomsuk said he covered human-trafficking crimes in Songkhla, Satun, Trang and Phang Nga provinces and the toughest issue was the Rohingya people who fled turmoil in Myanmar and wished to live here permanently. He said the refugees were a financial burden on the Thai government, but nothing could be done other than force them back into their country. Even then, they tend to sneak back in, he said.\n\nJeerawat cited Sadao district, where thousands of migrant children had no access to education and would possibly grow up to cause social problems in the future. He called on the foreign minister and other people in power to speak to Malaysia about pushing Rohingya refugees into Thailand as well as punish the state officials who help with the transfer.\n\nRoyal Thai Police representative Pol Colonel Surapong Muenpaopun said there were 2,000 registered Rohinya people in Thailand, but the actual figure could be larger and grow further if nothing is done to send them back to Myanmar.

Russian officials were angered by the fact that the Americans tell them what to do.\n\n""Instead of a thorough and objective analysis of the causes that lead to the growth of human trafficking, including on the territory of the United States, the authors of the report again used the unacceptable methodological approach, which divided countries into rating groups depending on political sympathies or antipathies of the U.S. State Department,"" a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry said Thursday.\n\nThe report on international human trafficking was prepared by the U.S. State Department. As for Russia, the text of the report says that there were 88 traffickers detained around the world last year owing to the joint work conducted by U.S. and Russian law enforcement officers. However, the USA could not help lecturing Russia. According to the authors of the report, Russian special services are not always willing to cooperate in the field of the struggle against human trafficking. The Russians could be more active, the report said. As a result, the USA downgraded Russia on the ranking of the countries that struggle against modern slavery. Previously, Russia was ranked in the second group of the ""control list"" - 188 countries indicated in the report were divided into three groups, depending on how successful their struggle is.\n\nIn the worst group, as the ""stronghold of global democracy,"" the United States, sees it, the Russian Federation was companied with Algeria, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Uzbekistan and others, including China, Cuba, North Korea, Iran and Syria.\n\nPredictably, the Russian Foreign Ministry was outraged with ""democratizing tools"" and ""mentoring"" of the United States.\n\n""We are not surprised by the fact that in the current report, Russia was included in the category of ""worst offenders"" that deserve punishment from the United States in the form of sanctions (specified in the U.S. law from 2000 ""On the protection of victims of human trafficking""). This fits into the logic of the recently enacted ""Magnitsky Law"" and other democratizing tools that the U.S. authorities have been trying to apply against Russia in connection with the allegedly growing pace of human rights violations in Russia,"" a statement from the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation said.\n\nRussian diplomats acknowledge that their American counterparts had repeatedly warned them that Russia could be included into the third group and therefore proposed to follow certain recommendations.\n\n""The Russian authorities will never be guided by the instructions developed in another country to struggle against organized crime. ... We have repeatedly told our U.S. counterparts that we were willing to continue constructive contacts ... without mentoring, though,"" officials from the Foreign Ministry of Russia said.\n\nAs for the possibility of applying sanctions against Russia, ""the very posing of this question is outrageous,"" added the Ministry. Russia would take adequate measures in return to unfriendly steps.","What a joke: USA to sanction Russia for human traffickingThe USA may single-handedly introduce sanctions again certain countries over the growth in the volume of human trafficking and the failure of many countries to successfully deal with the problem.\nThe U.S. State Department described Russia highly negatively at this point in its latest report on modern human trafficking.\nThe report on international human trafficking was prepared by the U.S. State Department.\nAccording to the authors of the report, Russian special services are not always willing to cooperate in the field of the struggle against human trafficking.\nAs a result, the USA downgraded Russia on the ranking of the countries that struggle against modern slavery.",United States,Russia,Papua,Libya,Article,Papua New Guinea,North Korea,Child Trafficking,Arts and Entertainment

Similar measures are being put proposed in California. The other states where minors under 18 are automatically considered trafficking victims and do not need to prove they were forced into prostitution, are Illinois, Kentucky, Vermont and Tennessee, according to the Polaris Project, which campaigns for stronger laws against human trafficking.\n\nLauren Hersh, the NY director of Equality Now, who have been advocating for the measures with lawmakers for months, said the current law in New York sends ""a bad message to victims"".\n\n""We need to start seeing children in prostitution as victims not 'child prostitutes' which implies a level of voluntariness,"" she said. ""One of the things traffickers say to victims is that law enforcement will never believe them. Here in NY state and world wide we need to shift that paradigm.""\n\nHersch said classifying sex trafficking as a violent rather than nonviolent felony would increase sentences and ""send a message that sex trafficking is inherently violent.""\n\nShe said: ""We need to make sure that politics doesn't get in the way of the necessary language in this bill and the bill is given for a vote.""\n\nA felony carries a minimum sentence of between one and three years' jail time and a maximum of between eight and 25 years. But making trafficking a more serious crime would increase the minimum sentence to between four and nine years and the maximum to between 12 and 25.\n\nThe measure to increase penalties is part of governor Andrew Cuomo's controversial 10-part Women's Equality Bill, which has now been broken down into 10 separate bills. Cuomo, a Democrat, acknowledged on Monday that one of the most contentious points, which would enshrine abortion rights into law, was unlikely to be taken up by the legislature this year. The bills also cover pay equity and sexual harassment.\n\nAdvocates said they hoped the trafficking measures would be voted on this week.\n\n'There is never really a choice'\n\nNew York was the first state to pass the Safe Harbour law, a 2008 statute that sought to protect sexually exploited children from prosecution by diverting them to family courts. But criminal law still allows anyone 16 or over to be prosecuted in a criminal court, so advocates say additional safeguards are needed.\n\nStella Marr, a former trafficking victim who is now the executive director of Sex Trafficking Survivors United, said that minors working as prostitutes should be offered help, not criminalised: ""Traffickers are violent, they threaten you, they threaten your family"" said Marr. ""I was manipulated, threatened and I felt I had no other choice. The trauma (from sexual violence and rape) changes your brain.\n\n""There is such a stigma you feel that you are not worth anything. If we are realistic about it, there is never really a choice. Sex trafficking and prostitution are intrinsically linked. Treating 16- and 17-year olds as criminals, when they have been so abused goes against humanity.""\n\nThere are few statistics on trafficking, but a Bureau of Justice Statistics study reported that out of thousands of suspected human trafficking incidents investigated between 2008 and 2010, 40% involved the sexual exploitation of a child.\n\nA report by the New York City administration for Children's Service this year, which acknowledged that data on sexually exploited children is difficult due to stigma and its hidden nature, quoted one 2007 study which estimated the number of sexually exploited children in New York City alone to be 2,200.\n\nStatistics form the division of criminal justice service in New York show that in 2011, NY state prosecuted ,3315 for prostitution but only 1,824 people were prosecuted for crimes of coercion, including patronising, promoting and compelling.\n\nThe Jewish Child Care Association (JCCA), which has a residential programme, Gateways, to house and help sexually exploited youth, see ""scores"" of children every year, some as young as 12 or 14, it said. Many have been prosecuted as a result of New York's law.\n\nRichard Altman, chief executive of the Jewish Child Care Association, said he was ""hopeful"" that the legislation would pass under this session.\n\n""I believe that the governor was recommending that it be de-coupled form the omnibus bill and if it's rewritten as a stand alone bill it will pass.""\n\nAltman said that, prior to the safe harbour act, they saw a ""significant number of young girls aged between 13 and 16 that were incarcerated in juvenile facilities"". The mean age is now 15.\n\nJames Dold, senior policy director of the Polaris Project said: ""Federal law says that minors do not have to prove they were coerced into prostitution. But if does not give them protection at the state level. If we recognise as a society that (minors) can't engage in sex in the first place, then how on earth can we prosecute them as prostitutes?""","In New York state, minors ages 16 and 17 can be arrested and prosecuted for prostitution, despite being considered not mature enough to consent to sex legally.\nOther measures being considered by the legislature include making trafficking a violent felony, which would increase penalties for perpetrators.\nHersch said classifying sex trafficking as a violent rather than nonviolent felony would increase sentences and ""send a message that sex trafficking is inherently violent.""\nShe said: ""We need to make sure that politics doesn't get in the way of the necessary language in this bill and the bill is given for a vote.""\nSex trafficking and prostitution are intrinsically linked.",Human trafficking,New York,Kentucky,Vermont,Incident,"New York, United States","Illinois, United States",Child Trafficking,Illicit Activities

Pictured is a room at the guest house CHIEF PROSECUTOR THANKS THE VICTIMS FOR GIVING EVIDENCE\n\nThe Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS Thames and Chiltern today described the abuse as 'appalling'. Following the sentencing Baljit Ubhey said he would like to thank the victims for 'having the courage to support the prosecution and give evidence in this case'. He said: 'Their bravery has ensured that seven sexual predators, who sought opportunities to target and sexually abuse and exploit vulnerable young girls, have been brought to justice.\n\n'The victims in this case were targeted because of their vulnerability and then cynically exploited.\n\n'They were given drink and drugs, they were shown attention to make them feel special, all of which was insincere and designed solely to make them feel indebted to their abusers.\n\n'They were then coerced into sexual acts by emotional pressure, intimidation, threats and violence.\n\n'As a result, these girls were left in absolutely no position to give true and free consent to those sexual acts.\n\n'This is an important point for other victims out there who may think that they won't be believed because they too seemingly ""agreed"" to sexual activity. He said Karrar, who refused to appear in court to be sentenced, treated one victim as his ‚Äòcommodity‚Äô and forced another to carry out ‚Äòdepraved sexual acts‚Äô.\n\nHe befriended one girl at the age of 11, before repeatedly raping her and selling her on to men from around the country for ¬£600 a time. At the age of 12 he physically branded her and forced her to have an illegal backroom abortion when she became pregnant by him. The teenage victim, who is now 19, was still so frightened of her attacker that she initially refused to give evidence for fear he would hurt her again. The parents of one of their victims said the men took their daughter away from them and they ‚Äòwill never get those lost years back‚Äô. In a statement they said: ‚ÄòThis has been a long and harrowing trial for our family to bear. ‚ÄòWe were a happy family, living in a good area. 'We never imagined this could be possible and we want to make other parents and carers aware that this type of crime can happen anywhere. ‚ÄòThese men deliberately targeted and groomed our daughter regardless of our family background.‚Äô\n\nLast night NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said there was ‚Äòa systematic failure to stop the gang earlier and protect the girls who raised the alarm on several occasions‚Äô. ‚ÄòWhilst we recognise the authorities in Oxford did eventually take effective and coordinated action, this took far too long,‚Äô he added.\n\n‚ÄòThe trial revealed staff knew one of the girls was being sexually groomed yet no immediate action was taken.‚Äô\n\n'Lessons need to be learnt and quickly': Campaigners ask if enough was done to protect victims of Oxford paedophile ring\n\nCampaigners have raised questions over why more was not done when some professionals seemed to be aware of wrongdoing (file picture)\n\nLessons must be learned from the case of a gang of men who exploited vulnerable girls, grooming, raping, and trafficking them, campaigners said.\n\n\n\nThe case has raised questions over why more was not done when some professionals seemed to be aware of wrongdoing.\n\n\n\nNSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said today's sentences sent a strong message to grooming gangs, but would bring little relief to victims who may have suffered irrevocable damage.\n\n\n\n'For them the story doesn't end here and they will need years of support to rebuild their lives,' he said.\n\n\n\n'Whilst we recognise the authorities in Oxford did eventually take effective and coordinated action, this took far too long.\n\n\n\n'There was a systematic failure to stop the gang earlier and protect the girls who raised the alarm on several occasions.\n\n\n\n'The trial revealed that staff knew one of the girls was being sexually groomed yet no immediate action was taken.\n\n\n\n'We need a fundamental shift in how the system treats vulnerable young people with all carers acting as good parents would when children are at risk.'\n\n\n\nHe said the positive development was that professionals are now treating the girls as victims rather than 'delinquent children' meaning more cases were being picked up and those needing help were getting the right protection.\n\n\n\n'We must build on the lessons learned here and make sure we now see the promised changes in culture from the police and the criminal justice system in which children coming forward to allege sexual abuse are treated seriously,' he added.\n\n\n\nJaved Khan, of independent charity Victim Support, said the control exerted by the men amounted to 'modern-day slavery'.\n\n\n\n'These were men who sought to deprive their victims of a voice and of their basic human rights.\n\n\n\n'The control they exerted only intensified the vulnerability of their victims and must surely be described as modern-day slavery.'\n\nHe said the charity would continue to help the women as they tried to rebuild their lives, and added: 'With serious cases of trafficking and grooming now exposed in Oxford, Telford and Rochdale, we must ask searching questions about the scale of the problem and what can be done both nationally and locally to ensure that vulnerable young people are protected from sexual slavery.\n\nThe seven members of the paedophile ring were jailed for at least 95 years at the Old Bailey (pictured) today\n\n'Recent announcements made by Ministry of Justice, the Crown Prosecution Service and College of Policing to improve how cases of sex abuse are investigated and prosecuted are absolutely welcomed, but as this case has shown agencies at all levels must work differently to reduce victimisation. Victim Support stands ready to play its full part in making this happen.'\n\n\n\nBarnardo's director of children's services Sam Monaghan said questions needed to be asked if enough was being done to support the victims of sexual exploitation.\n\n'What we have heard at the Old Bailey is chilling. The torment the child victims suffered will be a life sentence for them.\n\n\n\n'When sexually exploited children are so desperate to escape their ordeal that they consider committing suicide and are threatened with barbaric reprisals, we need to ask whether enough is being done to support them.\n\n'The trial revealed that staff knew one of the girls was being sexually groomed yet no immediate action was taken. We need a fundamental shift in how the system treats vulnerable young people with all carers acting as good parents would when children are at risk' - NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless\n\n'These men were able to abuse children for eight years. That can't be allowed to happen again. A fundamental shift in the collective mindset is needed at every level of the justice system.\n\n\n\n'This is a stark reminder that everyone who deals with vulnerable children must be trained to spot the signs of abuse and sexual exploitation to remember that in every case they are children.'\n\n\n\nAndy Dipper, from Oxford Community Against Trafficking (Oxcat) said they would be applying pressure to ensure changes in the justice and care systems.\n\n\n\n'Lessons need to be learnt and quickly. We want to make sure other victims understand we will listen, and we will believe them.'\n\n\n\nHe said: 'We have heard the recommendations from our senior politicians and now we must see action. There simply isn't time to waste.\n\n\n\n'Victims are being stigmatised and discouraged from reporting their horrific abuse because of a system which is ponderous, accusatory and further traumatises them.\n\n\n\n'The community, police and social services need to provide a safe haven for anyone - young or old, male or female - who is a victim of this horrendous crime.\n\n\n\n'Be in no doubt, Oxcat will be applying constant pressure to see changes in our justice system and care services. Don't forget this happened in Oxford, in our neighbourhood.'\n\n\n\nOxfordshire County Council said a serious case review carried out by the Oxfordshire Safeguarding Children Board started in May and will be published in full, but has not yet been completed.\n\n\n\nA statement from the county council said: 'The council hopes these sentences send out a strong message that child sexual exploitation will not be tolerated in Oxfordshire.\n\n\n\n'We would like to praise the courage of the victims for giving evidence in court that has led to these sentences, and we are sorry we did not stop it sooner.\n\n\n\n'We have learned a great deal about how to prevent and disrupt child sexual exploitation, and are working closely with other agencies to root it out in Oxfordshire.","Five gang members were given life sentences and two others were jailed for seven years for ‚Äòcrimes of the utmost gravity‚Äô.\nMohammed Karrar (left), 38, was given life with a minimum of 20 years for the 'dreadful offences' he committed against the girls.\nYou targeted the young girls because they were vulnerable, underage and out of control.\nHe said: 'Their bravery has ensured that seven sexual predators, who sought opportunities to target and sexually abuse and exploit vulnerable young girls, have been brought to justice.\n'We need a fundamental shift in how the system treats vulnerable young people with all carers acting as good parents would when children are at risk.'",Rape,Child sexual abuse,Rochdale,Telford,Incident,"Rochdale, Borough of Rochdale, England, United Kingdom","Telford, Telford and Wrekin, England, United Kingdom",Child Sexual Exploitation,Illicit Activities

The number of children migrating to the City per day is projected to cross a hundred, according to activists working for rescue of children in need of care and protection.\nIn the last three years, there has been an increase in the number of children below 18 years migrating to Bangalore, going by the experiences of Child Welfare Committee members and child rights activists here. Migration includes forced migration for employment and trafficking of children. Activists and officials said that they find many children from Bihar, Orissa and Jharkhand states being brought to the City with the lure of employment. A number of children from Bangladesh and Nepal have also been rescued over the past few months. \n‚ÄúIn the last three days, we have rescued around 30 children from one of the railway stations in the City,‚Äù said Basavaraju Sali, deputy secretary of Saathi, an NGO that has actively involved in rescuing children. According to him, the weekly trains from North Indian states that reach Yeshwantpur bring to the City a number of migrant children. Migrants from other South Indian states, including Andhra Pradesh, are usually found in the City Railway Station. \n‚ÄúWe have started a programme called early intervention. We identify children at the bus station and the railway station and rescue them from there,‚Äù said Sali. There is an organised team of brokers in the City who ensure that the children do not land in big groups, raising suspicion.\nThey make sure that the children once brought are used for employment in one or the other firm that is part of their chain, said Fr Edward Thomas, member of KSCPCR. The increasing employment opportunities in the City have resulted in increased incentive for child labour, Thomas observed. \n‚ÄúThe number of street children are decreasing. This is because there are brokers at all levels trying to broaden their benefits. They immediately take the children away, promising them employment. Hotels have a nexus too. Children are sent from one hotel to another and are forced into a vicious circle of labour,‚Äù he added. Bag making factories in the City, restaurants and industrial outlets are where the children are pushed into. \nTravel permits are a major concern when it comes to rehabilitation of children from other countries. \n‚ÄúWe may rescue a child here hailing from Bangladesh. To send him or her back home, that country's government should co-operate too. Government bodies should strengthen their co-ordination,‚Äù said Meena Jain, chairperson of Child Welfare Committee, Bangalore Urban. \nIn fact, rescuing children is just the first step. Ensuring that they are rehabilitated and that they are back in safe places is a challenging task for child rights activists and officials.\nChildren's shelter homes in the City are almost packed with rescued children, calling for the establishment of more such homes. To begin with, there have to be help desks in the railway stations and bus stands, opined Meena Jain and Fr Thomas. There is a need for multi-lingual banners in these places, giving helpline numbers for the benefit of children, in case they have been cheated by their employers.\n‚ÄúThis is one way to ensure that children who have landed in the City, amidst crisis, can at least go back to their hometowns safe,‚Äù Fr Thomas said.","Every day, at least 30 children arrive at the City Railway Station and in the Kempegowda Bus Station alone.\nThe number of children migrating to the City per day is projected to cross a hundred, according to activists working for rescue of children in need of care and protection.\nIn the last three years, there has been an increase in the number of children below 18 years migrating to Bangalore, going by the experiences of Child Welfare Committee members and child rights activists here.\nActivists and officials said that they find many children from Bihar, Orissa and Jharkhand states being brought to the City with the lure of employment.\nA number of children from Bangladesh and Nepal have also been rescued over the past few months.\nAccording to him, the weekly trains from North Indian states that reach Yeshwantpur bring to the City a number of migrant children.\nWe identify children at the bus station and the railway station and rescue them from there,‚Äù said Sali.\nThey make sure that the children once brought are used for employment in one or the other firm that is part of their chain, said Fr Edward Thomas, member of KSCPCR.\n‚ÄúThis is one way to ensure that children who have landed in the City, amidst crisis, can at least go back to their hometowns safe,‚Äù Fr Thomas said.",Train station,Public transport,Andhra Pradesh,Nepal,Incident,"Bihar, Bogra, Rajshahi Division, Bangladesh",Nepal,Child Trafficking,Child Marriage

5e82277e0dc171d3c93e7451,http://www.foreignpolicyjournal.com/2013/07/06/the-economics-of-human-trafficking/,The Economics of Human Trafficking,"Trafficking of Kachin women and children is emerging as a serious crisis. Kachin Women‚Äôs Association Thailand‚Äôs latest report, ‚ÄúPushed To The Brink‚Äù (June 2013), updates on trafficking of Kachin women and girls amidst renewed conflict in the region. Migration, displacement, and lack of aid have increased women‚Äôs vulnerability to trafficking along the China-Myanmar border. Victims are sold as bonded laborers and brides, or to brothels and massage parlors in China. Thailand‚Äôs sex-industry is another destination. Children abducted to Thailand are forced to work as beggars and street-hawkers or to supply its child prostitution industry.\n\nWhat are the catalysts to the trafficking scenario of the Kachin? What are the economics of trafficking dictating the issue?\n\nFactors Fuelling Trafficking of the Kachin\n\nPoor governance lies at the heart of increased vulnerability to the trafficking crisis. Victims include hundreds of displaced Kachins fleeing conflict between the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) and the Myanmarese military. State policies force Kachin women to migrate: substitute occupations are not provided after curbs on opium faming; multinational projects cause displacement; and revenues generated are not diverted for development. Resultant stagnation escalates poverty and starvation. The regime restricts opportunities for upward mobility, driving girls to seek jobs for financing education. With no local avenues available, international aid agencies offer potential for relief. However, Myanmar blocks humanitarian agencies from providing aid to the Kachin. In June 2013, the UN was allowed to deliver assistance to displaced people for the first time in almost a year. The positive news is juxtaposed with reports that China is restarting the suspended Myitsone dam project in 2015. Internally-displaced persons (IDPs) thus not returning to their villages face the risk of being trafficked.\n\nTraffickers intercept women IDPs and migrants seeking employment. Abduction strategies include deceit, force, drugs, or job offers. Women continue to be tricked into sexual slavery. It reflects the scenario of the female section of society perceiving itself responsible for earning a livelihood. Ironically, the Kachin are a patriarchal community. Yet, opium addiction renders large numbers of men unemployable. Workingmen leave camps or homes for faraway places, increasing women‚Äôs susceptibility. Few Kachin soldiers‚Äô wives sell their children when they are away fighting. Work related migration is sought to finance Kachin youths‚Äô rampant drug abuse.\n\nChina‚Äôs one-child policy has led to 117 men for every 100 women. By 2020, 30 million single Chinese men will face ‚Äòbride shortages‚Äô against 24 million women. This spurs trafficking, as Kachin women are preferred for their fair skin and proximity to the border. Chinese culture prefers male offspring and Kachin women are thought as fertile child-bearers. Black markets thrive in Yunnan, and even as far as eastern China.\n\nHigh demand for child beggars in Thailand is in line with the tourism boom. Another likely link is to supply adoption rackets in Thailand. Trafficked children arrive in Bangkok, Samut Sakhon, Mae Sai, and Mae Sot. Some are beaten by owners to garner pity from almsgivers. Thailand‚Äôs million-dollar sex-tourism industry attracts visitors from East Asia and Europe. Traffickers use the Internet to dodge international forces against child prostitution and to ensure sustained demand.\n\nKachins are alleged to be trafficked to Pakistan, also a destination for Shan state‚Äôs billion-dollar heroin smuggling industry. A small Kachin population resides here. While there is no evidence of the two industries being linked, it is possible the same criminal networks profit from both ventures.\n\nEconomics of Trafficking\n\nKachin women and children are a profitable income source for traffickers, many of whom are struggling migrants themselves. Women form 70 percent of the victims. Kachin brides fetch highest prices‚Äîup to $6,500 from buyers. Chinese businessmen form a significant proportion of the clientele. Chinese construction workers and laborers unable to afford dowries for local wives pay brokers to fetch women from Myanmarese families struggling on $1 a day. Traffickers, learning the local customs, masquerade as marriage brokers in Kachin and promise a dowry to the family. Very few make the payment of about $150. The same amount is quoted as monthly wages to lure women desiring work in Yunnan. Trafficked sex-workers are often raped and have ‚Äòlesser value‚Äô, being sold from $300 upwards to the prostitution industry in South China.\n\nChildren trafficked to Thailand are occasionally rented out from parents. Brokers offer $100 ‚Äì $224 a month for children. Buyers earn high returns as the children make $15 ‚Äì $100 a day. Three-month old toddlers to ten-year olds are favored, as they are believed to be most appealing. A shop assistant earns almost $6000 a month. In this commercial setup, few children are seen to attempt an escape. NGO efforts and stricter Thai laws are increasing rescue efforts, spiraling traffickers to ensure a steady supply of victims.\n\nThe push factors of conflict and poverty, and the pull factor of a lucrative black market have shaped the trafficking of the Kachin into a vicious cycle. Kachin brides rarely obtain a safe environment, and trafficked children receive only basic food and accommodation.

The trafficking of Ghanaians, particularly children, within the country is more prevalent than the transnational trafficking of foreign migrants.\nGhanaian boys and girls are subjected to conditions of forced labor within the country in fishing, domestic service, street hawking, begging, portering, artisanal gold mining, and agriculture. Ghanaian girls, and to a lesser extent boys, are subjected to prostitution within Ghana. Child prostitution, and possibly child sex tourism, are prevalent in the Volta region and are growing in the oil-producing Western regions.\nGhanaian women and children are recruited and transported to Nigeria, Cote d?Ivoire, Burkina Faso, The Gambia, South Africa, Israel, Syria, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States for forced labor and forced prostitution. Women and girls voluntarily migrating from China, Nigeria, Cote d?Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Benin are subjected to commercial sexual exploitation after arriving in Ghana. Citizens from other West African countries are subjected to forced labour in Ghana in agriculture or domestic service.\nDuring the reporting period, there was an emergence of fraudulent recruitment agencies that advertised locally for jobs abroad, generally in the domestic service and retail sectors; as a result, there was an increase in the number of Ghanaian women migrating to the Middle East to work in these sectors, some of whom were subsequently forced into prostitution upon their arrival.\nThe Government of Ghana does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so. During the reporting period, the government initiated 75 investigations, conducted five prosecutions, and secured three convictions of trafficking offenders. The government also drafted a new five-year national action plan and continued to conduct information and education campaigns throughout the country.\nHowever, the government failed to provide any specialized anti-trafficking training to law enforcement officials and did not provide sufficient funding to properly maintain government-operated shelters.\nIncrease efforts to investigate and prosecute trafficking offenses, and convict and punish trafficking offenders; ensure the police?s Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) has adequate resources to conduct law enforcement efforts; train law enforcement personnel to proactively identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations?such as females in prostitution and children working in agriculture?and refer them to protective services; adopt the legislative instrument to implement effectively the 2005 Human Trafficking Act; increase government funding for protective services to victims, including to the Human Trafficking Fund; ensure the maintenance of government-operated shelters; improve data collection and reporting on victims identified and assisted; reinstate quarterly meetings of the Human Trafficking Management Board and provide adequate resources to the board to implement the National Plan of Action against Trafficking; and accede to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.\nThe government maintained anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts during the reporting period. The 2005 Human Trafficking Act?amended in 2009 to align its definition of human trafficking with that of the 2000 UN TIP Protocol?prohibits all forms of trafficking and prescribes penalties of five to 20 years? imprisonment for all trafficking crimes. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with penalties prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape.\nDuring the reporting period, the government initiated 75 trafficking investigations and secured three convictions; this demonstrates a significant decrease from the previous reporting period, when the government initiated 91 investigations and convicted 29 traffickers.\nAll three offenders were convicted for sex trafficking offenses; two received five-year prison sentences and one received a seven-year sentence.\nAt the close of the reporting period, two prosecutions and 42 investigations remained pending. In October 2012, the Government of Ghana collaborated with the Government of Burkina Faso in an INTERPOL-led operation, which resulted in the rescue of 387 child trafficking victims from various West African nations subjected to forced labor in gold mines and cotton fields in Burkina Faso; the Ghanaian Police sent 16 officers to participate in the operation and assisted in 30 arrests.\nDuring November and December 2012, the government began an operation against sex trafficking in close cooperation with the Government of Nigeria?s National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons and Other Related Matters (NAPTIP); as a result of this operation, authorities rescued 82 Nigerian and 41 Ghanaian victims and apprehended 10 Nigerian and six Ghanaian suspected trafficking offenders. As a result of these investigative efforts, five prosecutions were completed during the reporting period; one additional case is pending. The government completed the pilot phase of the Ghana Child Labor Monitoring System (GCLMS)?a database concerning forced child labor and trafficking at the community level?in 60 cocoa-producing communities across six districts; however, no arrests or prosecutions resulted from this effort. Government officials cited the need for the enactment of a legislative instrument to implement effectively the 2005 Human Trafficking Act; at the end of the reporting period this instrument was awaiting Ministerial action before moving to Parliament for approval. Officials also stated police and prosecutors lacked the training and resources to prosecute trafficking cases fully; however, neither the government nor any outside entities conducted specialized anti-trafficking training for government officials during the reporting period.\nThe government did not report any investigations or prosecutions of public officials for alleged complicity in trafficking-related offenses during the reporting period.\nThe government decreased efforts to protect victims during the year. The AHTU reported identifying 262 victims, but only referring 33 on an ad hoc basis to government and NGO-run facilities offering protective care.\nThe government did not employ formal procedures to identify victims among vulnerable groups, such as women in prostitution or children at work sites. The Ghanaian Police Service maintained a 24-hour hotline for reporting crime, including trafficking; the hotline received an unknown number of trafficking-related calls during the reporting period.\nThe Department of Social Welfare (DSW) paid for medical costs associated with caring for identified victims, while international organizations sponsored psychiatric rehabilitation and care. In partnership with an international organization, the government operated one short-term open shelter specifically for trafficking victims; this shelter was equipped to take both child and adult victims, but in practice, adults were often placed in hotels and hostels when space was not available.\nThe DSW also maintained a multipurpose shelter for abused children, which cared for an unknown number of trafficking victims during the reporting period. If reintegration with family members was not possible, children may have been placed in foster families with approval from the courts or a government-run orphanage; it is unknown whether this occurred in 2012. Both shelters only provided short-term care, generally limiting victims? stays to three months, although extensions were granted on a case-by-case basis. It is unknown how much funding the government dedicated to victim protection and assistance, but NGOs and government officials reported the funding was inadequate. Government officials reported that the Human Trafficking Fund, which was established by the 2005 Human Trafficking Act to finance protection efforts, lacked funds; as a result, shelters operated in sub-par conditions without the resources to make basic repairs and government officials had to use their own personal funds to assist victims. The government encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders, and provided them with protective escorts and legal counsel during trial proceedings.\nThe government continued to offer foreign victims temporary residency during the investigation and prosecution of their cases and, with the interior minister?s approval, permanent residency if deemed to be in the victim?s best interest; no victims sought temporary or permanent residency during the year. There were no reports that victims were penalized for unlawful acts committed as a direct result of being trafficked.\nThe government sustained its anti-trafficking prevention efforts during the reporting period. The Human Trafficking Management Board (HTMB)?an entity chaired by the Minister for Women and Children?s Affairs and comprised of government agencies and NGOs?only met twice during the reporting period; officials cited a lack of funding as a reason for not conducting mandated quarterly meetings.\nThe HTMB drafted a new five-year national action plan, which addresses anti-trafficking activities for 2013 through 2018. With support from international organizations and NGOs, the government conducted anti-trafficking information and education campaigns throughout the country, including sensitization programs in the Volta Region and cocoa-producing communities. State-owned radio and television programs also aired anti-trafficking programming. The aforementioned joint operation with Nigeria?s NAPTIP was driven in part by the government?s attempts to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. The government took no discernible measures to decrease the demand for forced labor, despite acknowledging the growing number of unlicensed employment agencies that are increasingly facilitating the trafficking of Ghanaian women to the Middle East.\nThe government did not provide anti-trafficking training to Ghanaian troops prior to their deployment abroad on peacekeeping missions, though such training was provided to Ghanaian troops by foreign donors. Ghana is not a party to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.","2013 Trafficking in Persons Report,¬† the Ghanaian government has failed to provide any specialized anti-trafficking training to law enforcement officials.\nGhana is a country of origin, transit, and destination for men, women, and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking.\nDuring the reporting period, there was an emergence of fraudulent recruitment agencies that advertised locally for jobs abroad, generally in the domestic service and retail sectors; as a result, there was an increase in the number of Ghanaian women migrating to the Middle East to work in these sectors, some of whom were subsequently forced into prostitution upon their arrival.\nDuring the reporting period, the government initiated 75 investigations, conducted five prosecutions, and secured three convictions of trafficking offenders.\nHowever, the government failed to provide any specialized anti-trafficking training to law enforcement officials and did not provide sufficient funding to properly maintain government-operated shelters.\nIncrease efforts to investigate and prosecute trafficking offenses, and convict and punish trafficking offenders; ensure the police?s Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) has adequate resources to conduct law enforcement efforts; train law enforcement personnel to proactively identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations?such as females in prostitution and children working in agriculture?and refer them to protective services; adopt the legislative instrument to implement effectively the 2005 Human Trafficking Act; increase government funding for protective services to victims, including to the Human Trafficking Fund; ensure the maintenance of government-operated shelters; improve data collection and reporting on victims identified and assisted; reinstate quarterly meetings of the Human Trafficking Management Board and provide adequate resources to the board to implement the National Plan of Action against Trafficking; and accede to the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.\nThe government maintained anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts during the reporting period.\nIn October 2012, the Government of Ghana collaborated with the Government of Burkina Faso in an INTERPOL-led operation, which resulted in the rescue of 387 child trafficking victims from various West African nations subjected to forced labor in gold mines and cotton fields in Burkina Faso; the Ghanaian Police sent 16 officers to participate in the operation and assisted in 30 arrests.\nDuring November and December 2012, the government began an operation against sex trafficking in close cooperation with the Government of Nigeria?s National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons and Other Related Matters (NAPTIP); as a result of this operation, authorities rescued 82 Nigerian and 41 Ghanaian victims and apprehended 10 Nigerian and six Ghanaian suspected trafficking offenders.\nOfficials also stated police and prosecutors lacked the training and resources to prosecute trafficking cases fully; however, neither the government nor any outside entities conducted specialized anti-trafficking training for government officials during the reporting period.\nThe AHTU reported identifying 262 victims, but only referring 33 on an ad hoc basis to government and NGO-run facilities offering protective care.\nThe Ghanaian Police Service maintained a 24-hour hotline for reporting crime, including trafficking; the hotline received an unknown number of trafficking-related calls during the reporting period.\nThe DSW also maintained a multipurpose shelter for abused children, which cared for an unknown number of trafficking victims during the reporting period.\nIt is unknown how much funding the government dedicated to victim protection and assistance, but NGOs and government officials reported the funding was inadequate.\nGovernment officials reported that the Human Trafficking Fund, which was established by the 2005 Human Trafficking Act to finance protection efforts, lacked funds; as a result, shelters operated in sub-par conditions without the resources to make basic repairs and government officials had to use their own personal funds to assist victims.\nThe government encouraged victims to assist in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking offenders, and provided them with protective escorts and legal counsel during trial proceedings.\nThe Human Trafficking Management Board (HTMB)?an entity chaired by the Minister for Women and Children?s Affairs and comprised of government agencies and NGOs?only met twice during the reporting period; officials cited a lack of funding as a reason for not conducting mandated quarterly meetings.",Prostitution,Human trafficking,China,Israel,Article,Nigeria,China,Child Trafficking,Illicit Activities

Their pimps and those buying their sex might call them prostitutes. But if they are not prostituting themselves by choice, they are victims. Their pimps, who control their behavior, often with violence, threats and drugs, are the criminals.\n\nOn Thursday, Gov. Paul LePage held a ceremonial signing of a bill, LD 1159, sponsored by Rep. Mark Dion, D-Portland, that gives Maine its first sex trafficking law. By replacing ‚Äúaggravated promotion of prostitution‚Äù with ‚Äúsex trafficking‚Äù in Maine law, the legislation shows a shift in cultural understanding of the crime. By adding sex trafficking as a human trafficking offense, it makes resources available to survivors. The law also increases penalties for traffickers and allows for more flexibility in the sentencing of ‚Äújohns.‚Äù\n\nNow that Maine has the law, it will need the tools to enforce it. That means police, health care providers and district attorneys will have to think differently about what they are encountering in their distinct but connected professions.\n\nToo often, for example, pimps are arrested or prosecuted for side matters ‚Äî such as money laundering, drug deals or assault ‚Äî that don‚Äôt cut to the heart of their most egregious offense. Or doctors might see patients with rapid repeat pregnancies or abortions, a high number of reported sex partners, general ill health and a high incidence of sexually transmitted infections. Instead of treating individual problems, they must put the pieces together, know how to ask the right questions and connect their patients to the best resources.\n\nFor a long time, police performed their duty to uphold the law and arrested those acting as prostitutes: Undercover officers pretended to be customers, solicited sex and then arrested the man or woman. But police have gradually shifted their perception and approach, and trafficking convictions have followed suit.\n\nAn analysis by the police department in Anaheim, Calif., for example, found that prostitution activity always returned no matter how many women were arrested. The women often came from similar backgrounds of neglect and abuse, and a majority told police selling themselves was their only way to survive. The police came to realize many of the women were being trafficked.\n\nAnaheim police changed their strategy and began an effort to help women escape their dangerous situations and identify pimps as possible suspects. Instead of arresting the women, they began to take them off the street and bring them to a comfortable room at the police department where they could discuss the manipulation that led to their prostitution. They connected them with resources and pursued the traffickers with victims‚Äô help.\n\nFrom the project‚Äôs inception in August 2011, through Oct. 31, 2012, 38 pimps were arrested and charged; 20 were convicted. At that time, 18 awaited trial, and Anaheim police had rescued 52 human trafficking victims.\n\nA change in awareness is also happening in Maine. In May, Sgt. Tim Farris of the Portland Police Department testified in support of LD 1159 and described what he had learned over the previous two years through interviews with hotel staff and girls involved in the sex trade. These were stories of people ‚Äúbeing severely beaten, raped and choked unconscious, at times hoping for death,‚Äù he said. At the same time, he said police did not have the resources to adequately assist victims. They needed to coordinate with other agencies and build public awareness.\n\nSo they did. More than 500 police officers and providers have been trained on human trafficking prevention in the last couple years and specific groups are building response strategies. The Greater Portland Coalition Against Sex Trafficking and Exploitation formed in 2011 and similar groups are coalescing in Lewiston and Bangor. LD 1159 follows the work of many to bring the problem to the fore.\n\nMaine communities may not have the population of Anaheim, but sex trafficking exists here and will only get worse if the state does nothing. With a statute referring specifically to sex trafficking, police agencies will be better able to record and track cases that otherwise might be listed as prostitution or drug possession. It will help with enforcement to have a legal definition that‚Äôs broader than other applicable, but narrower, offenses, such as criminal restraint or kidnapping.\n\nPerhaps most importantly the law reflects a shifting perception that people selling sex are not necessarily prostitutes but possible victims. Not all the time, but very often, someone else is profiting from the sex acts performed by those who feel they have no choice.","Paul LePage held a ceremonial signing of a bill, LD 1159, sponsored by Rep. Mark Dion, D-Portland, that gives Maine its first sex trafficking law.\nBy replacing ‚Äúaggravated promotion of prostitution‚Äù with ‚Äúsex trafficking‚Äù in Maine law, the legislation shows a shift in cultural understanding of the crime.\nBy adding sex trafficking as a human trafficking offense, it makes resources available to survivors.\nThe Greater Portland Coalition Against Sex Trafficking and Exploitation formed in 2011 and similar groups are coalescing in Lewiston and Bangor.\nPerhaps most importantly the law reflects a shifting perception that people selling sex are not necessarily prostitutes but possible victims.",Human trafficking,Prostitution,"Bangor, Nova Scotia","Lewiston, Maine",Incident,"Lewiston, Androscoggin County, Maine, United States","Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales, United Kingdom",Child Trafficking,Accommodation/Hotel/Motel

It also said the government should vigorously pursue trafficking investigations and prosecutions ¬†of trafficking offenses, and impose adequate sentences on ¬†convicted trafficking offenders, including imprisonment ¬†whenever appropriate just as it urged for proactive measures to investigate ¬†and prosecute government officials suspected of trafficking related corruption and complicity in trafficking offenses.\n""The Government of Nigeria demonstrated modest progress in its ¬†anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts during the year. The 2003 ¬†Trafficking in Persons Law Enforcement and Administration ¬†Act, amended in 2005 to increase the penalties for trafficking ¬†offenders, prohibits all forms of human trafficking.¬†\n""The law ¬†prescribes penalties of five years‚Äô imprisonment or a fine not to ¬†exceed the equivalent of approximately $645 or both for labor ¬†trafficking offenses; these are sufficiently stringent, but the law ¬†allows convicted offenders to pay a fine in lieu of prison time ¬†for labor trafficking or attempted trafficking offenses, resulting ¬†in penalties not proportionate to the crimes committed.¬†\nThe ¬†law prescribes penalties of 10 to 15 years‚Äô imprisonment for sex ¬†trafficking offenses and a fine of the equivalent of approximately ¬†$1,250, or both. For sentences that include only a fine, penalties ¬†are not sufficiently stringent. In 2011, NAPTIP introduced ¬†amendments to the anti-trafficking law, which would give ¬†prosecutors more authority and restrict the ability of judges ¬†to offer fines in lieu of prison time during sentencing; this ¬†amendment was awaiting approval by the National Assembly ¬†at the end of the reporting period""","The report which was presented by the Secretary to the US government, Senator John Kerry at the Department of State yesterday, noted that¬†  ¬† Nigeria was a source, transit, and destination country for women ¬†and children subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking.\nThe report said: ""Children from West African countries ‚Äì primarily ¬†Benin, Ghana, and Togo ‚Äì are forced to work in Nigeria, and ¬†many are subjected to hazardous labor in Nigeria‚Äôs granite ¬†mines.\nThe 2013 US Reports on Human Trafficking berated the government of Nigeria for not fully complying with the ¬†minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking, though, it stressed that during the reporting ¬†period, the government demonstrated a modest increase in ¬†anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts through the conviction ¬†of 25 traffickers and the provision of specialized anti-trafficking ¬†training to officials by various government ministries and ¬†agencies.\nDespite these efforts, the ¬†government has yet to pass draft legislation that would restrict ¬†the ability of judges to offer fines in lieu of prison time during ¬†sentencing and the Nigerian Police Force (NPF) continued ¬†to experience difficulty identifying trafficking victims.\n""The law ¬†prescribes penalties of five years‚Äô imprisonment or a fine not to ¬†exceed the equivalent of approximately $645 or both for labor ¬†trafficking offenses; these are sufficiently stringent, but the law ¬†allows convicted offenders to pay a fine in lieu of prison time ¬†for labor trafficking or attempted trafficking offenses, resulting ¬†in penalties not proportionate to the crimes committed.\nIn 2011, NAPTIP introduced ¬†amendments to the anti-trafficking law, which would give ¬†prosecutors more authority and restrict the ability of judges ¬†to offer fines in lieu of prison time during sentencing; this ¬†amendment was awaiting approval by the National Assembly ¬†at the end of the reporting period""",Human trafficking,Prostitution,France,Germany,Article,Nigeria,Greece,Child Trafficking,Domestic Work/Servitude

It concluded: ‚ÄúThe bishops decided to let him go to the USA. They, in effect, set him loose on the unsuspecting population of Stockton, California. There is no record that they notified the Bishop of Stockton of his arrival.‚Äù\n\n\n\nMcCabe was extradited from America in August 2010 but walked free from court last March after an 18 month jail term was backdated by a judge.\n\n\n\nThe shocking report names Archbishops Dermot Ryan, Kevin McNamara and Cardinal Desmond Connell and is hugely critical of their handling of McCabe.\n\n\n\nThe Irish Times reports that Archbishop Ryan was Archbishop of Dublin between 1972 and 1984, Archbishop McNamara from 1984 to 1987, and Cardinal Connell from 1988 to 2004.\n\n\n\nThe newly released chapter also points to ‚Äòshocking police connivance‚Äô which had the effect of ‚Äòstifling one complaint and failing to investigate another, and in allowing the then Fr McCabe to leave the country‚Äô.\n\n\n\nThe Irish Times report says that McCabe was arrested in the US in August 2010 and extradited to Ireland in June 2011. He was jailed for 18 months after he pleaded guilty to the indecent assault of five schoolboys but the sentence was backdated.\n\n\n\nThe Murphy Commission said it was made aware of 21 complainants where McCabe was concerned.\n\n\n\nIt says McCabe served in Dublin at the Pro Cathedral from 1971 to 1978, in Artane from 1978 to 1981,in Clogher Rd., Crumlin from 1981 to 1983 and then in the Santa Rosa diocese in California from 1983 to 1986. His faculties as a priest were withdrawn in 1987 and he was laicised in 1988.\n\n\n\nThe Murphy report says: ‚ÄúArchbishop Dermot Ryan not only about knew about the complaints against Fr McCabe, he had a considerable understanding of the effects of abuse on children. This is one of the few cases in which he took a close personal interest.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúArchbishop Ryan protected Fr McCabe to an extraordinary extent; he ensured, as far as he could, that very few people knew about his activities; it seems that the welfare of children simply did not play any part in his decisions.‚Äù\n\n\n\nIt adds that during the tenure of Archbishop Kevin McNamara, from 1984 to 1987, Fr McCabe returned to Ireland in May 1986 from the US under a cloud following ‚Äòstories of inappropriate conduct‚Äô at a parish in California.\n\n\n\nThe Murphy Report adds: ‚ÄúTo the knowledge of the archdiocese, Fr McCabe stayed on in Dublin for the summer of 1986. His activities appear to have been entirely unmonitored, despite the archdiocese‚Äôs knowledge that he had been declared a paedophile and despite its knowledge of many complaints against him. He moved from house to house and he had the use of a car.‚Äù\n\n\n\nWhile in Dublin then he abused a nine year old altar boy.\n\n\n\nMcCabe returned to the US briefly but, unknown to the church, he returned to Dublin in 1987 when he got a job in a school.\n\n\n\nThe report says that when the archdiocese heard of this the school was informed about McCabe‚Äôs history and he was removed.\n\n\n\nA meeting of Dublin‚Äôs Auxiliary Bishops in January 1988, attended by Archbishop-elect Desmond Connell, was told that he had assaulted a 14-year-old boy at a school Mass.\n\n\n\nThe Vatican was contacted and asked that Fr McCabe ‚Äòbe reduced to the lay state as quickly as possible otherwise immense scandal and damage will ensue both for the Church and the priesthood in this Diocese‚Äô.\n\n\n\nThe report adds that in May 1988 the diocese of Sacramento became aware of McCabe‚Äôs presence in California and, as the Murphy report put it, ‚Äòassumed, wrongly of course, that the Dublin Archdiocese might not have been aware of his presence in Stockton‚Äô.\n\n\n\nThe Sacramento church authorities informed the Dublin bishops that it had a duty which they intended to fulfil, to notify Stockton about McCabe, which they did.\n\n\n\nThe Irish police are also criticised for their handling of the 1986 allegation of abuse of a nine year old boy, reported by the boy‚Äôs parents.\n\n\n\nAt the time Fr McCabe was staying in a west Dublin house owned by Chief Superintendent Joe McGovern. He was interviewed by two officers in connection with this incident but the file went missing.\n\n\n\nThe Irish Times says that on that same evening McCabe visited Chief Superintendent Joe McGovern and\n\n\n\nthere, according to the Murphy report, he ‚Äòmade certain limited admissions to the chief superintendent who did not convey them to the investigating garda (police), but who did convey them and the fact of the Garda investigation to his local parish priest, Fr Curley.‚Äù\n\n\n\nChief Superintendent McGovern told the Murphy Commission ‚Äòhe considered Fr McCabe‚Äôs behaviour to be a matter for the Church to deal with‚Äô.\n\n\n\nThe Murphy Report said: ‚ÄúThe detective handling the investigation contacted an official in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) seeking advice. The investigation stopped. No further inquiries were made by the garda√≠ (police). ‚ÄúEven though the garda√≠ (police) knew that Fr McCabe intended to return to the USA, no warrant was sought for his arrest.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe Murphy report concluded: ‚ÄúThe Archdiocese‚Äôs handling of events was facilitated in significant ways by the garda√≠ (police).\n\n\n\n‚ÄúThe Commission is of the view that this particular Garda (police) investigation was marred by Church interference which was facilitated by the garda√≠ (police) and which was material in allowing Fr McCabe to evade justice.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúBetween 1988 and 2003 not a single inquiry had been made by the garda√≠ (police) in relation to this matter. In the Commission‚Äôs view, it is difficult not to conclude that the renewed interest in the complaint in 2003 was prompted more by a fear of public opprobrium then by any realistic prospect of successfully concluding the investigation.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúThe connivance by the Garda√≠ (police) in effectively stifling one complaint and failing to investigate another, and in allowing Fr McCabe to leave the country is shocking.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIt is noteworthy that the Commission would not have been aware of the Garda (police) activity in question were it not for the information contained in the Church files.‚Äù\n\n\n\nA police spokesman said they would not be commenting on Chapter 20 until they had an opportunity to read it.","Three former Archbishops of Dublin have been damned in the latest publication of the Murphy report into clerical abuse of Ireland ‚Äì and accused of dumping a known paedophile on a parish in California.\nIt contains damning allegation against the Archbishops over their handling of former priest Patrick McCabe, now 77 and a convicted serial child abuser.\nAt one point in 1988 McCabe was sent to St Patrick‚Äôs psychiatric hospital in Dublin but while there he told diocesan authorities he had secured a job working with homeless people at Stockton, California.\nThe Murphy Report adds: ‚ÄúTo the knowledge of the archdiocese, Fr McCabe stayed on in Dublin for the summer of 1986.\nAt the time Fr McCabe was staying in a west Dublin house owned by Chief Superintendent Joe McGovern.",Desmond Connell,Diarmuid Martin,Santa Rosa,Artane,Incident,"Pro Cathedral, Leinster, Ireland","Artane, Dublin City, Leinster, Ireland",Child Sexual Exploitation,Arts and Entertainment

Corridor of the Northern Region, particularly areas around Zabzugu and Tatale, is fast becoming a transit point for human trafficking activities.\nAccording to statistics made available by the Domestic Violence and Victims Support Unit (DOVVSU) of the Ghana Police Service, 18 people aged between four and 19 were trafficked to neighbouring countries such as Mali, Togo and Nigeria by a syndicate operating in the area in 2012 alone.\nIn 2010, two cases were recorded in the Walewale area.\nHowever, due to intensive surveillance being mounted by the police and other stakeholders, it appears the activities of the group are being frustrated.\nCommunities along the Eastern Corridor¬† include Saboba, Chereponi, Yendi, Gushiegu, Salaga and Nanumba South and North districts.\nThe DOVVSU, with support from the Department of Social Welfare and Recfam, a local non-governmental organisation, has been able to reintegrate 30 children who were previously trafficked along the Zabzugu/Tatale area into their respective families and communities.\nAs a result of the intensive surveillance to stem the tide, two suspects who were allegedly involved in human trafficking at Tatale under the pretext of offering their victims jobs in Nigeria were arrested by the Northern Regional Police Command on June 19, 2013.\nIssah Yakubu, 26, and Abdul Karim Habib, 29, were said to have so far trafficked 18 Ghanaians, mainly children, to Nigeria.\nTheir modus operandi is to persuade their victims into believing that when they are sent to Nigeria they will be offered jobs which could enable them to buy motorbikes within a relatively short time.\nThe Regional Crime Officer, Superintendent of Police Alhaji Arhin Mahama, told The Mirror in Tamale that the police, upon a tip-off, mounted surveillance on the suspects.\nHe explained that Yakubu and Habib, in their latest operation, had completed arrangements and succeeded in trafficking three Ghanaians to Nigeria before they were arrested by the police.\nThe names of two of the victims were given as Seidu Yahaya and one Osman but the name of the third victim is yet to be known.\nThe officer said when Yakubu and Habib were questioned, they admitted committing the offence and added that they had an accomplice called Annan who traffics the victims¬† to Nigeria.\nYakubu and Habib, according to Alhaji Mahama, gave the phone number of the accomplice to the police who in turn called the number and spoke to the victims.\nThey (the victims) allegedly lamented about the deplorable situation they found themselves in Nigeria.\nThe Mirror also gathered that in recent times human trafficking in Tatale is increasing partly because the area is close to the Togo border.\nThe United Nations Children?s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimate that between 200,000 and 300,000 children are trafficked each year for forced labour and sexual exploitation in West and Central Africa.\nIt has been observed that the figures might be higher, since there is no reliable data due to various reasons such as the underground and illegal nature of human trafficking, the lack of anti-trafficking legislation in some African countries and the reluctance of the victims to report their experiences to the authorities.\nAccording to the Regional Coordinator of DOVVSU, Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Emmanuel Holortu, parental neglect, inability of parents to control their children, poverty and broken homes are some of the major causes of human trafficking along the corridor.\nHe said most of the victims, who were mainly children, fell prey to those engaged in that criminal act partly because their parents were divorced and had entered into new relationships, hence they were exposed as there was no care for them.\nHe further revealed that in the case of a particular four-year-old boy who was trafficked to Mali, his own father gave him out to the traffickers.\nThe DOVVSU Regional Coordinator once again observed that these victims, particularly the girls, suffer from all forms of abuse, including the fact that some of them are used as sex slaves or for prostitution while their male counterparts are engaged in menial jobs.\nASP Holortu was of the view that there must be effective monitoring and surveillance to clamp down on the activities of the syndicate, noting that a lot of activities had been put in place in collaboration with non-governmental organisations to nip the practice in the bud.\nSource: The Mirror","The Eastern Corridor of the Northern Region,

Part of that is during the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally,"" Jackley said.\nThe annual report on crime recently issued by the attorney general's office showed South Dakota law enforcement agencies reported 30 arrests for assisting or promoting prostitution in 2012, up from nine arrests in 2011.\n""I don't want the public to think we have this huge human trafficking situation in South Dakota. We've had some cases that justify the need to look at it to educate ourselves and work on prevention, and that's the approach we're taking,"" Jackley said.\nGeody VanDewater, assistant chief of the Sturgis Police Department, said officers from various agencies made about six arrests for prostitution during last year's rally.\n""Everybody thinks there's money to be made during the rally. There are different types of people out there trying to find out how to make their buck, you know. Some of them are doing prostitution,"" VanDewater said.\nUniversity of South Dakota associate professor Elizabeth Talbot, who conducts research into human trafficking, said it's difficult to know the extent of the problem in South Dakota. The large crowds and party atmosphere associated with the motorcycle rally lend themselves to forced prostitution, she said.\n""Human trafficking is a problem in South Dakota. It's a problem everywhere,"" said Talbot, director of the university's master of social work program.\n""You might be looking at someone who's trafficked and forced to behave in certain ways and not know you're looking at someone who's not voluntarily participating,"" she said.\nJackley declined to give details on what officers will be trained to look for, saying he doesn't want to tip off offenders.\nBut Talbot said one indication of human trafficking is an older man with a much younger woman. Research indicates that the average age someone is forced into prostitution is between 12 and 18, she said.\nTalbot said she's pleased law officers are being trained to fight human trafficking because it amounts to slavery. No one knows the exact extent of the problem in South Dakota and the nation, she said.\n""We really don't know the scope of human trafficking,"" Talbot said. ""It might not be a large problem in South Dakota, but then it might be. We really just don't know.""\nWhen the 2011 South Dakota Legislature passed a law specifically outlawing human trafficking, supporters said some women had been forced to work as prostitutes during the annual motorcycle rally. Brendan Johnson, U.S. attorney for South Dakota, recently announced that a task force of local, state and federal officials will combat human trafficking in the state.\nJackley said the state is fighting human trafficking by training officers and conducting sting operations. Officials also are studying whether state laws need to be changed, but kidnapping laws can help fight human trafficking by providing sentences of up to life in prison, he said.\nThe attorney general also said he and his counterparts in nearly every other state are asking Congress to give states authority to prosecute people who run online sites that advertise prostitution. The law now gives jurisdiction to federal authorities, but states need authority to combat those crimes, he said.\n""You can hire an adult escort service, you can buy children and other things that are contrary to South Dakota law,"" Jackley said.","PIERRE, South Dakota ‚Äî South Dakota law enforcement agencies plan to step up their fight against the forced prostitution of young women and children at this year's Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.\nAttorney General Marty Jackley said law officers who will work during this year's Aug. 5-11 rally will be trained to detect and prevent human trafficking at the event that annually draws hundreds of thousands of bikers to western South Dakota.\nThe annual report on crime recently issued by the attorney general's office showed South Dakota law enforcement agencies reported 30 arrests for assisting or promoting prostitution in 2012, up from nine arrests in 2011.\nGeody VanDewater, assistant chief of the Sturgis Police Department, said officers from various agencies made about six arrests for prostitution during last year's rally.\nUniversity of South Dakota associate professor Elizabeth Talbot, who conducts research into human trafficking, said it's difficult to know the extent of the problem in South Dakota.\nTalbot said she's pleased law officers are being trained to fight human trafficking because it amounts to slavery.\nNo one knows the exact extent of the problem in South Dakota and the nation, she said.\nWhen the 2011 South Dakota Legislature passed a law specifically outlawing human trafficking, supporters said some women had been forced to work as prostitutes during the annual motorcycle rally.\nJackley said the state is fighting human trafficking by training officers and conducting sting operations.",Prostitution,Human trafficking,United_States,South Dakota,Article,United States,,Child Trafficking,Illicit Activities
5e822a9e0dc171d3c93e7647,http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?newsid=45504&cr=sexual+exploitation&cr1=,Madagascar: UN rights expert calls for greater efforts to tackle child sexual exploitation,"‚ÄúThe scourge of sexual exploitation of children through prostitution or sex tourism is omnipresent and too often justified by poverty. Its exponential growth, in particular since 2009, underlined by all stakeholders met, is alarming,‚Äù said Najat Maalla M‚Äôjid, the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.\n\n‚ÄúIts actual scope remains difficult to determine, due, among other factors, to reluctance to report and fear of reprisals. The low number of reported cases is very rarely followed by heavy sanctions, as provided by Malagasy law,‚Äù she stated in a news release issued following her official visit to the country.\n\nDuring her 15 to 26 July mission, the expert met with various State and local authorities, as well as representatives from UN agencies, the diplomatic community, civil society and the private sector. She also met child victims and went to the main spots of child sexual exploitation in the capital, Antananarivo, as well as in Toliara, Nosy Be and Toamasina.\n\nMs. Maalla M‚Äôjid noted the alarming poverty affecting 92 per cent of the population, as a result of successive political crises. This socio-economic precariousness affecting families and communities has considerably increased the number of children out of school and the vulnerability of children to all forms of economic and sexual exploitation, she noted.\n\nShe also raised with concern the survival strategy adopted by many parents who encourage their children to enter prostitution.\n\nMadagascar, the expert pointed out, has a relatively complete legal framework but the implementation of these laws is significantly compromised by a lack of effectiveness due to corruption, impunity and difficult access for children to reporting mechanisms ensuring their protection and security.\n\n‚ÄúAmicable settlements take place at the expense of the rights of children, whose voice is rarely taken into account,‚Äù the news release stated.\n\nDespite initiatives such as the National Committee for the Protection of Children, Child Protection Networks and centres for legal and psychological counselling, care and assistance to children remains very partial and suffers from a significant lack of resources.\n\nThe Special Rapporteur stressed the gravity of the situation and the necessity to act urgently to ensure an integrated protective framework for children.\n\n‚ÄúIt is unacceptable that so many lives of Malagasy children are sacrificed under the excuse of the current political and economic crisis,‚Äù said Ms. Maalla M‚Äôjid, who encouraged the international community to support the establishment of integrated child protection and development plans at the local level to efficiently combat all forms of violence, abuse and exploitation of children.\n\nIndependent experts, or special rapporteurs, are appointed by the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council to examine and report back on a country situation or a specific human rights theme.

For this reason, the government plans to pass new laws to prevent human smuggling,"" Mohamed Osman Dube, Somaliland's administrative director in the interior ministry, told IRIN.\n\nAt present, Article 457 of Somaliland‚Äôs penal code identifies the selling and purchasing of humans as slaves as offences punishable by prison terms of 3 to 12 years. Article 466 further provides for a three-year prison term for those found guilty of engaging in physical abuse, according to Mustafe Mahdi, a Somaliland lawyer.\n\nThe new laws are aimed at reducing irregular migration from Somaliland to Ethiopia and onwards to Sudan, Libya and Europe. When passed, they are expected to include tougher punishments for smugglers and to provide ways to rehabilitate youth migrants, added Dube.\n\nWhile solid figures on people smuggling and human trafficking in Somaliland are not available, in late June, Somaliland President Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud (Silanyo) nominated a ministerial committee to address the problem, expressing concern over growing youth mass migration and related deaths.\n\nAccording to a recent survey by the community-based Somaliland Youth Ambition Development Group (SYADG), for example, at least 15 Somaliland youths died in May in the Sahara desert, between Libya and Sudan, either from being shot dead by smugglers or due to the harsh conditions. The 15 were part of a group of 325 youths, from which 31 are still missing, with 83 and 80 others in Libyan and Tunisian prisons, respectively, according to SYADG spokesperson Ahmed Jamal.\n\nTargeted\n\nMost of the youths migrating from Somaliland have been from poorer families, but those from better-off families are increasingly risking the perilous journey to Europe.\n\n""When I was looking for my son, I received a phone call from a stranger asking me to speak my son. The stranger told me to pay him US$5,000 in smuggling fees. I said, 'I will look for the money', but unfortunately, my son was shot dead,"" Mohamed Da'ud, the director of planning in Somaliland's interior ministry, told IRIN.\n\n""My son is among youths who have been killed by smugglers or [who] died in the Sahara after they tried to run away from smugglers.""\n\nAccording to Wafa Alamin, a human rights activist based in Khartoum, Sudan, ‚ÄúIllegal immigrants are treated like animals by the smugglers in the Sahara, between Sudan and Libya.‚Äù\n\nSmugglers are also increasingly kidnapping migrant Somaliland youths for ransom.\n\n""The youths are asked about their parents‚Äô properties and jobs. If the smugglers identify that the family of the person can pay a ransom, they take him or her across the border without any payment only to later force the client to call his or her family to demand a ransom,‚Äù explained Abdillahi Hassan Digale, the chairman of the Ubah Social Welfare Organization (USWO).\n\nAbdillahi Omar's sons are among the smugglers‚Äô victims.\n\n""If the smugglers identify that the family of the person can pay a ransom, they take him or her across the border without any payment only to later force the client to call his or her family to demand a ransom""\n\n""My two sons graduated from high school in 2011 and had no reason to risk their lives,"" said Omar. ""I sent one of them to university in Ethiopia, but he saved up the money I used to send him to make the risky journey to Libya. On different occasions in Sudan and Libya he was held hostage by smugglers who demanded a ransom, and I spent $14,500 on him. But he is lucky he reached Europe.""\n\nOmar's other son, the younger one, is now in Libya. ""I don't know what to do. I sold everything I had. My problem is not only being bankrupt but that I don't know how to bring him back,"" he said.\n\nWay forward\n\nThe government, civil society and international organizations have been engaging in public awareness campaigns to sensitize the Somaliland population on the dangers of irregular migration.\n\nBut more needs to be done.\n\n""Even though a lot of campaigns have been done, [especially] in the last several weeks, and youth migrants have decreased from 15 per day to eight per day, we believe that there are local smugglers connected to other smugglers based in Ethiopia, Sudan and Libya, and we don't think it will stop soon,"" said a Somaliland border immigration official who preferred anonymity.\n\nThe high rate of unemployment in Somaliland must be addressed amid an increasing number of university graduates, according to USWO's Digale. ""For this reason, there is a need for interventions by both the government and the local business community, as well as international partners working in Somaliland,"" he said.\n\nA past survey by the Somaliland National Youth Organization found about 75 percent of the youths there to be unemployed.\n\nAt present, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is implementing a regional mixed migration programme covering Djibouti, Ethiopia, Puntland, Somaliland and Yemen. In mixed migration, refugees, asylum-seekers, economic migrants and even victims of human trafficking use the same routes, means of transport and smuggling networks to reach shared destinations, but with different claims to protection and humanitarian assistance.\n\n‚ÄúThe overall objective of this programme is to strengthen the protection of - and provide emergency assistance to - irregular migrants in Somaliland, Puntland [and] Djibouti, and potential migrants and returnees in Ethiopia, including the assisted voluntary return of the most vulnerable,‚Äù said IOM Somalia. Ethiopia is a leading source country of irregular migrants from the Horn of Africa region heading to the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nIOM Somalia is also urging Somaliland to accede to the Palermo protocol, which aims to prevent the smuggling of migrants, promote cooperation among state parties, protect the rights of smuggled migrants, and prevent the worst forms of exploitation, which often characterizes the smuggling process.\n\nOn 17 July, Somaliland officials prosecuted 11 people on human smuggling charges. The Gabiley Regional Court ‚Äúfound the 11 men guilty of smuggling youths from Somaliland to Ethiopia en-route to Libya‚Äù, said an official with Somaliland‚Äôs immigration department.

How can you claim to fight trafficking, yet sit at a safe distance?\n\nThe first time that I rescued a child from slavery was in 2005. He was a 13-year-old boy who had been trafficked from central to southern Vietnam to sell flowers on the streets of Saigon.\n\nHis name was Ngoc, and he had never been to school, had never learned to read or write his own name. His family lived in a tin shack on the beach, and when a woman came to visit them one day offering training and employment for their son, they thought they'd been offered the deal of a lifetime. They had no idea that they were giving up their own child to human traffickers.\n\nSince then, the understanding of the complex nature of trafficking in Vietnam has increased. For example, in 2010 the Vietnamese government finally accepted the phenomenon of ""domestic trafficking"" for the first time, meaning that the plight of hundreds of young children like Ngoc is finally gaining recognition.\n\nIn Vietnam, and across the world, the fight against human trafficking and slavery is becoming the cause of the moment. But here, and around the world, instead of direct action to free victims, the anti-trafficking movement has become too focused on the message. Instead of driving all available funds into physically rescuing children like Ngoc, we are instead becoming fixated on media soundbites and campaigning, such as bringing pop bands to Vietnam to ""learn about human trafficking"".\n\nConsiderable resources are being ploughed into awareness-raising and campaigning that could be used to rescue children from appalling conditions of slavery. For example, I believe the tens of millions of dollars devoted to MTV Exit could have been better spent on rescuing kids and prosecuting their traffickers.\n\nMy organisation, Blue Dragon Children's Foundation, has rescued about 300 trafficked children from slavery since 2005. This includes girls and boys forced to work on the streets, in garment factories or in brothels, both in Vietnam and in China.\n\nOur approach is very direct. We identify children as young as 10 who have been taken against their will, or tricked into thinking they are going to training and jobs. We find where they are and we go to get them. Sometimes this involves accompanying police and government officials; sometimes we are on our own.\n\nWe've driven cars up to brothels at pre-arranged times and waited for girls to make a run for it. We've pretended to be ""customers"" in brothels and made whispered escape plans. We've confronted factory owners, faced abuse and violence and stared down furious traffickers who know they stand to lose their income if we have our way.\n\nOnce the rescue is complete, we provide for the child's health, education and accommodation, and we work with the police to go after the traffickers. Every arrest means dozens more children are safe from trafficking.\n\nYet apart from a handful of post-rescue services such as safe houses and counselling, most anti-trafficking work going on in Vietnam right now is confined to awareness raising activities rather than frontline work. Organisations which claim to fight trafficking and yet sit at a safe distance, preparing campaigns and conferences, are not having an impact where it counts: on the ground.\n\nOrganisations are largely unwilling to get involved in rescue work because they consider it too dangerous. Of course there's an element of danger in all this, but the greater danger is in leaving children enslaved. Human trafficking is a high-stakes criminal activity. There is no risk-free way to stop it.\n\nWhat's more, the language being used is a misguided impression of the work they are doing. Many campaigns are using the word ""rescue"" when in fact they mean ""follow-up services"", such as post-rescue accommodation and counselling. These services are undoubtedly important, but it is perhaps giving the misguided impression that these campaigns are doing something that they are not.\n\nMy fear is that these campaigns are creating the impression that we are winning the war against the traffickers, this lulling the public into the false impression that something substantial is being done, when in fact slavery is still thriving in the world. Soon people may start to question the anti-trafficking movement, realise it has not delivered what it promised ‚Äì the end of human slavery ‚Äì and give up on it. We simply can't afford to let this happen.\n\nIf we really want to end trafficking, we need to get out into the field and rescue the girls, boys and adults who have been trafficked and then ensure that their traffickers are prosecuted and put permanently out of business.\n\nMichael Brosowski is founder of Blue Dragon Foundation, Vietnam.

He case is not related to the weekend raids\n\nThe FBI said 60 percent of the children rescued were in foster care or group homes when they ran away.\n\n\n\n'With no way to survive on their own they are lured into a life of being trafficked for sex,' Hosko said.\n\n\n\nGirls are enticed into the sex trade with compliments and offers of making money 'and then they are trapped in this cycle that involves drugs, it involves physical abuse, it may involve torture... so that they are tied to the pimp,' he said.\n\n\n\nHosko added: 'Commonly they don't see law enforcement as their friends' but rather as a threat of arrest.\n\nThe largest numbers of children rescued were in San Francisco, Detroit, Milwaukee, Denver and New Orleans.\n\n\n\nTo identify victims of sex trafficking, agents went undercover in major cities and posed as men looking for sex. They also used Backpage, a website that is used to sell girls for sex.\n\nRon Hosko, assistant director of the FBI's Criminal Investigative Division, announced that the agency has rescued 105 children who were forced into prostitution in the U.S.\n\nCrackdown: FBI agents used Backpage, a website that is used to sell girls for sex, to identify victims of prostitution during a sting earlier this year\n\nArrests: Over three days in July FBI agents arrested 150 suspected pimps\n\n'YOU CANNOT EVER LET THEM TAKE YOUR HEART:' INSIDE THE TERRIFYING LIFE OF A CHILD PROSTITUTE\n\nAlex, now 21, was a victim of child sex trafficking Alex left home at the age of 16 and was sucked into prostitution because she couldn't afford to eat.\n\n'At first it was terrifying, and then you just kind of become numb to it,' she told the FBI. 'I felt empty. You are at the bottom of the bottom. And you have nobody to go to... for help or for a hug. There‚Äôs nobody.'\n\nAfter two years on the streets, Alex reached out to the FBI, which helped her get back on her feet and arrested the 'pimps' involved in trafficking her - Sacramento residents Tynisha Marie Hornbuckle and Tamrell Rena Hornbuckle. As a result of their crimes, Tynisha was sentenced to 15 years in prison and Tamrell was sentenced to 12 years in prison.\n\nAlex has since earned her high school diploma and she plans to attend college.\n\nOffering her advice to other victims of child sex trafficking, she said, 'They can take everything from you; your voice, your freedom, they can take your fight and will, your everything. But you cannot ever let them take your heart; you have to always keep fighting.'\n\n'Many times the children that are taken in in these types of criminal activities are children that are disaffected, they are from broken homes, they may be on the street themselves,' FBI Acting Executive Assistant Director Kevin Perkins said. 'They are really looking for a meal, they are looking for shelter, they are looking for someone to take care of them.'\n\nOverall, 47 FBI divisions took part in the raids, dubbed 'Operation Cross Country VII,' along with more than 3,900 local, state, and federal law enforcement officers and agents representing 230 separate agencies.\n\n\n\nTaking place over the course of three days in 76 cities, it i s the largest ever enforcement action against child sex trafficking in the U.S.The suspects who were arrested will likely face both federal and state charges of trafficking.\n\n\n\nSince 2003, the FBI has rescued more than 2,700 children from sexual exploitation, according to the agency. The previous rescue operations have resulted in the convictions of 1,350 suspects and the seizure of more than $3.1 million in assets.\n\n'Child prostitution remains a persistent threat to children across the country,' Hosko said.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department estimates that nearly 450,000 children run away from home each year, one-third of whom will be lured into prostitution within 48 hours of leaving home.\n\nThat was the case with Alex, a woman who left home at the age of 16 and joined a prostitution ring because she couldn't afford to eat.\n\n\n\nIn a video posted to the FBI's website on Monday, Alex, now 21, says life as a child prostitute was 'terrifying.'\n\n\n\nAlex said she left home at the age of 16 and was sucked into the sex trade because she couldn't afford to eat\n\nA woman is arrested in connection with 'Operation Cross County' in Atlantic County, New Jersey\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral arrests are made in connection with child sex trafficking. The Justice Department estimates that nearly 450,000 children run away from home each year, one-third of whom will be lured into prostitution within 48 hours of leaving home\n\n'At first it was terrifying, and then you just kind of become numb to it,' she said. 'Not like an alter ego but just like a different person, you put on a whole different attitude - I felt empty. You are at the bottom of the bottom. And you have nobody to go to... for help or for a hug. There‚Äôs nobody.'\n\nAfter two years of sexual exploitation, Alex contacted the FBI for help. The information that she provided helped the agency nab two pimps and rescue several other victims.\n\n\n\nAlex has since earned her high school diploma and she plans to attend college.

Adults like Todd Bacchus, who authorities say pimped a 17-year-old runaway from Terrebonne Parish, advertising her online for paid sex with buyers in Metairie and Houston.\nAlthough Bacchus, 25, of New Orleans, was booked Monday in Jefferson Parish with human trafficking and trafficking of a child for sex purposes, his arrest wasn't part of the sweeping, 76-city FBI trafficking sting, dubbed Operation Cross Country. But he and other alleged purveyors of preteen and teenage prostitution represent a troubling trend in the Crescent City, according to Michael J. Anderson, special agent in charge of the FBI's New Orleans Division. Bacchus had been tracked by authorities for some time and a warrant for his arrest was issued in March. Authorities caught up to him in Houston earlier in July.\nA state statute makes it illegal to recruit, harbor, transport or sell anyone younger than 18 for the purpose of engaging in commercial sexual activity.\nDuring the recent three-day sting, New Orleans area investigators recovered four juveniles and arrested at least 16 adults on prostitution-related charges. ""There was no special event in town,"" Anderson said. ""We weren't doing this during Mardi Gras or the Super Bowl. We had the numbers that we did on a fairly normal weekend.\n""We've got a serious problem here that's a year-round issue,"" he said.\nLocal arrests began as 'dates'\nNationally, agents recovered 105 children during the operation, which is conducted annually and is in its seventh year, according to Mary Beth Romig, spokeswoman for the FBI's New Orleans Division. Authorities also arrested 150 people suspected of pimping or sexually exploiting the juveniles for financial gain.\nLocally, law enforcement officers set up ""dates"" with targets through websites regularly used to advertise prostitution, Anderson said. They arrested the suspects after deals were cut for money in exchange for sex.\nRomig said suspect Shenikkia Lyons, 26, of New Orleans, was arrested twice during the sting. Local authorities recovered two 15-year-olds and two 16-year-olds during the weekend operations. Romig did not release any other information about the girls.\nAnderson admitted that although the stings are performed to locate children forced into prostitution, the majority of those who end up arrested are adults. ""The only way you can ferret out and filter out the juveniles is by this approach,"" he said.\nVulnerable youths\nThe youngest victim rescued during the national FBI operation was 13. Among the children who are sexually exploited in the United States, that's the age when the exploitation begins, according to Taryn Offenbacher, director of communications for Shared Hope International Inc. The nonprofit agency works to prevent sex trafficking and help restore victims.\nChild victims are usually girls, she said. Every survivor's story is different, but the common thread, Offenbacher said, is vulnerability. The juveniles fall prey to pimps who work to identify their needs and exploit them.\n""Perhaps she is sexually abused at home,"" Offenbacher said. ""If she needs protection, he can provide that. Maybe she's not being fed at home or she doesn't have adequate clothing. He can take care of that. He'll take the time to get to know what the girl needs.""\nAnderson said victims are often runaways with troubled home lives, girls who believe the pimp is their boyfriend. That man brings them into the business to be trained by adult prostitutes. The pimps use drugs, alcohol, fear and intimidation to keep the girls in line, he said.\nThe Terrebonne case\nBacchus is accused of recruiting a teenage runaway into prostitution. The 17-year-old was first reported missing to the Terrebonne Parish Sheriff's Office on July 5, 2012, according to Capt. Dawn Foret, spokeswoman for the department. Houston police finally found her in August 2012, though Bacchus was not arrested then.\nThe girl told investigators she and an 18-year-old friend were approached by a woman named Nina while they were visiting New Orleans. It was Nina who introduced the girls to Bacchus, the report said.\nBacchus allegedly set up prostitution advertisements online and rented a Metairie motel room, the report said. He also took the teen and her friend to Houston where he did the same, taking all of their money after each ""date.""\nState Police handled the probe into Bacchus' activities, according to Trooper Melissa Matey, spokeswoman for the department. State Police obtained a warrant for his arrest in March. Houston police took him into custody on July 3; he has since been returned to Jefferson Parish.\nLocal authorities have uncovered similar cases in recent months, including the July 10 arrest of Andrea Birdow, 22, of Sherman, Texas, accused of training a 16-year-old girl for prostitution at a Metairie motel. State Police in June arrested Eric Nettles, 31 for allegedly bringing a Texas runaway to the New Orleans area for prostitution.\nNo easy answers\nRoughly one in four adults engaged in prostitution began as minors, Anderson said. Once in that life, it's almost impossible to get away, he said. Authorities ""do the relatively easy part,"" he said. ""We identify them. We go in and we round them up. The real challenge is to rehabilitate these girls and get them back on track.""\nLocally, several non-governmental agencies work to provide victims with the resources to restart their lives, including the New Orleans Human Trafficking Working Group, Free Nola and Eden House, a free residence with programs designed to help trafficking survivors or women trying to leave prostitution.\nRecovered child-trafficking victims who suffered abuse or shattered home lives can potentially fall prey again if those vulnerabilities aren't addressed. ""It's the reason we shy away from the word 'rescue,'"" Offenbacher said. ""You can't just pluck somebody out of the situation.""","Todd Bacchus, 25, of New Orleans, was booked Monday with trafficking a child for sex purposes and human trafficking.\nWhen FBI agents partnered with the New Orleans Police Department, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office and Louisiana State Police to conduct sex trafficking stings during this past weekend, they were hoping to snare adults who were forcing juveniles into prostitution.\nAdults like Todd Bacchus, who authorities say pimped a 17-year-old runaway from Terrebonne Parish, advertising her online for paid sex with buyers in Metairie and Houston.\nAlthough Bacchus, 25, of New Orleans, was booked Monday in Jefferson Parish with human trafficking and trafficking of a child for sex purposes, his arrest wasn't part of the sweeping, 76-city FBI trafficking sting, dubbed Operation Cross Country.\nBacchus had been tracked by authorities for some time and a warrant for his arrest was issued in March.\nDuring the recent three-day sting, New Orleans area investigators recovered four juveniles and arrested at least 16 adults on prostitution-related charges.\nNationally, agents recovered 105 children during the operation, which is conducted annually and is in its seventh year, according to Mary Beth Romig, spokeswoman for the FBI's New Orleans Division.\nAuthorities also arrested 150 people suspected of pimping or sexually exploiting the juveniles for financial gain.\nLocally, law enforcement officers set up ""dates"" with targets through websites regularly used to advertise prostitution, Anderson said.\nRomig said suspect Shenikkia Lyons, 26, of New Orleans, was arrested twice during the sting.\nAmong the children who are sexually exploited in the United States, that's the age when the exploitation begins, according to Taryn Offenbacher, director of communications for Shared Hope International Inc.

The enforcement action, Operation Cross Country, combined the efforts of local law enforcement, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and 47 FBI divisions, including the Denver office with the Rocky Mountain Innocence Lost Task Force described in the Boulder Weekly story ‚ÄúTracking down the trafficked,‚Äù published July 25.\n\nFBI agents spent 72 hours over the weekend of July 27 on the nationwide effort, which took place in 76 cities and led to the arrests of 152 suspected pimps.\n\n‚ÄúChild prostitution remains a persistent threat to children across America,‚Äù Ron Hosko, assistant director of the FBI‚Äôs Criminal Investigative Division, said in a press release from the FBI. ‚ÄúThis operation serves as a reminder that these abhorrent crimes can happen anywhere and the FBI remains committed to stopping this cycle of victimization and holding the criminals who profit from this exploitation accountable.‚Äù\n\nThis was the seventh Operation Cross Country organized by the FBI‚Äôs 10-year-old Innocence Lost National Initiative. The initiative‚Äôs efforts have led to the recovery of 2,700 children.\n\nThe Denver FBI office has also reported that during the operation they arrested six alleged pimps and identified 11 pimps, cited/arrested 51 adults for prostitution, arrested 25 johns and arrested six adults for other crimes, including four felonies.\n\nLocal agencies involved included police departments in Aurora, Casper, Colorado Springs, Denver, Greenwood Village, Lakewood, Pueblo and Wheat Ridge; sheriff ‚Äôs offices in Arapahoe, Douglas, Jefferson and Pueblo counties; the FBI; Homeland Security Investigations; the United States Marshals; and Wyoming Division Criminal Investigation.\n\n‚ÄúHuman trafficking is a multijurisdictional-type crime, so it requires a multijurisdictional effort against it,‚Äù Sgt. Dan Steele, a Denver Police officer who works on the FBI‚Äôs division of the Innocence Lost Task Force, told Boulder Weekly. ‚Äú[Traffickers] go to all sorts of different jurisdictions, they go interstate, they go out of country even, so that requires not only having multiple agencies involved, and not as restrictive boundaries, but also having the federal government involved to have that reach where we need it.‚Äù\n\nTask force operations often begin as local enforcement actions in truck stops, casinos, street ‚Äòtracks‚Äô and on dating or escort service websites, according to a press release from the FBI Denver office. Arrests for prostitution or solicitation can provide information on more organized, cross-state trafficking operations.\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs really no one way we find these trafficking victims,‚Äù Ricky Wright, the FBI coordinator for the Rocky Mountain Safe Streets task force, told Boulder Weekly. Wright has been with the FBI 16 years and has been working on the Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force, specializing in violent crimes against children, for six years. His first work with child prostitution enforcement was on an Operation Cross Country roughly five years ago.\n\n‚ÄúA lot of times, once we think we have an idea, or any knowledge really that a girl out there might be involved in prostitution, we start looking for her, and since a lot of it‚Äôs online anymore we can try to find escort ads they might be posting,‚Äù Wright says.\n\nAn online search for Denver escorts could return dozens of such websites.\n\nFBI agents and police partner with the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs offices and the U.S. Department of Justice‚Äôs Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section to collect evidence to bring charges.\n\nBecause of the time between the initial arrest and the trial for an accused pimp or trafficker, the victims are not often available to testify.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where it‚Äôs nice to have this multijurisdictional task force where we have the time to work on proving the case beyond that reasonable doubt, even beyond having the victim,‚Äù Steele says. ‚ÄúThat means going back through and taking every little piece of information that the child or the adult gave us and corroborating every little piece of information so that basically the amount of information is so overwhelming that it puts the prosecutors in a position of power.‚Äù\n\nRespond: letters@boulderweekly.com","A nationwide sweep to search for children who were being commercially sexually exploited found 106 juvenile victims of sex trafficking nationwide, nine of whom were recovered by efforts coordinated by the Denver division of the FBI.\nDan Steele, a Denver Police officer who works on the FBI‚Äôs division of the Innocence Lost Task Force, told Boulder Weekly.\nWright has been with the FBI 16 years and has been working on the Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force, specializing in violent crimes against children, for six years.\nHis first work with child prostitution enforcement was on an Operation Cross Country roughly five years ago.\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where it‚Äôs nice to have this multijurisdictional task force where we have the time to work on proving the case beyond that reasonable doubt, even beyond having the victim,‚Äù Steele says.",Human trafficking,Police,Casper,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",Incident,"Casper, Natrona County, Wyoming, United States","Colorado Springs, El Paso County, Colorado, United States",Child Trafficking,Illicit Activities

Instead, the monarch pardoned 48 Spanish prisoners, including a man convicted of raping children.\n\nThe apparent bureaucratic mixup has embarrassed both countries, prompting rare protests in Morocco and an ultimately successful scramble to find the freed pedophile. It has also raised legal questions about the fate of the other 29 Spaniards believed incorrectly pardoned.\n\nPolice captured 63-year-old convicted pedophile Daniel Galvan Vina in southeastern Spain on Monday after he had nearly a week of freedom. Galvan had been convicted of raping 11 children and was serving a 30-year sentence in Morocco.\n\nMorocco's King Mohammed retracted his pardon of Galvan over the weekend, and Morocco, via Interpol, issued an international arrest warrant for him. Because Spain does not extradite its citizens to Morocco, Galvan will likely finish his term in a Spanish prison.\n\nA Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesperson said some of the 48 are believed to be back in Spain and others are still in Morocco. Most were reportedly serving time for drug-related offences, and there was no word from Morocco that any more pardons would be rescinded.\n\nThe requests for pardons and prison transfers came during Spanish King Juan Carlos's four-day official visit to Morocco last month, and Morocco's consent was viewed as a gesture that would benefit bilateral relations.\n\nA Spanish official confirmed that Spain asked Morocco to transfer 30 convicts to prisons in Spain while requesting that a separate list of 18 prisoners be pardoned and freed.

""If they aren't placed in a juvenile detention facility, the child could run back to the prostitution scenario.""\n\nTo avoid this, police charge the children with prostitution and place them in a detention facility until housing elsewhere becomes available, according to Shehan.\n\nFBI spokeswoman Whitney Malkin confirmed to U.S. News that some of the child victims rescued by Operation Cross Country could be detained, though she called such instances ""rare"" and said many more children would be placed in safe housing by FBI Victim Specialists.\n\n""Detaining victims... falls far short of ideal,"" she says, but noted ""the infrastructure to support the range of services just isn't there in many places.""\n\nIn a May report, anti-sex trafficking group Shared Hope International said government agencies and law enforcement needed to do better at placing child sex trafficking victims in domestic shelters or providing other services. The group urged better communication between service providers, more training for law enforcement on trauma responses and more diverse options for placement.\n\nSienna Baskin at the Urban Justice Center, a New York-based advocacy group that works with sex trafficking victims, says the FBI should also provide more clarity on how many minors were detained in this particular sweep and where the others were placed.\n\n""It seems like they're treating the arrest of minors as an acceptable collateral consequence of this operation. But arrest is a very traumatic experience that can lead to abuses for both adults and minors,"" she says.\n\nThe FBI was not able to immediately provide the number of detained children, or the number of female sex workers arrested in the sting ‚Äì another concern of anti-trafficking groups about Operation Cross Country.\n\nIn their July newsletter, the Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation said it believed police had used the sting as an opportunity to arrest more adults in prostitution. Stephanie Richard, policy and legal services director at the Los Angeles-based Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking, says her group is also concerned about arrests of female sex workers in the sting because ""we have not received assurances from those conducting these raids about whether or not adult women could be victims as well.""\n\nIn past sweeps, the FBI released the numbers of prostitutes it had arrested, but it no longer does so. Local media reports on the sweep aggregated by feminist blogger and activist Emi Koyama suggest the number of sex workers arrested in Operation Cross Country may have been as high as 1,000.\n\nBut Shehan insists the ""number one focus"" of the operation was to recover minors, not arrest prostitutes. ""Will [the FBI] leverage the interaction if they encounter an adult? Absolutely,"" she says. ""But recovering juveniles from trafficking is the highest priority.""","""If they aren't placed in a juvenile detention facility, the child could run back to the prostitution scenario.""\nTo avoid this, police charge the children with prostitution and place them in a detention facility until housing elsewhere becomes available, according to Shehan.\nIn a May report, anti-sex trafficking group Shared Hope International said government agencies and law enforcement needed to do better at placing child sex trafficking victims in domestic shelters or providing other services.\nThe FBI was not able to immediately provide the number of detained children, or the number of female sex workers arrested in the sting ‚Äì another concern of anti-trafficking groups about Operation Cross Country.\nIn past sweeps, the FBI released the numbers of prostitutes it had arrested, but it no longer does so.",Federal Bureau of Investigation,Human trafficking,United States,,Incident,"New York, United States","Los Angeles, Los Angeles County, California, United States",Child Trafficking,Illicit Activities

However, as labour shortages rose to unmanageable levels at the height of the Pacific War in 1944, Japan‚Äôs cabinet approved bringing unskilled labourers from the Korean Peninsula on August 8 that year.\n From then on, massive numbers of Koreans were conscripted as labourers and shipped to Japan and other occupied territories including China and Southeast Asia. \n ‚ÄúSome academics estimate that as many as 2 million Koreans were conscripted as soldiers and support staff for the Japanese military and as labourers,‚Äù said Park In-hwan, chief of the Commission on Verification and Support for the Victims of Forced Mobilisation under Japanese Colonialism of Korea. In comparison, the Korean population of the peninsula stood at about 23.5 million in 1940. \n Of the estimated 2 million conscripted, about 1.3 million were shipped abroad and the remainder were sent to build military facilities in various locations on the Korean Peninsula including Jeju Island and the south coast. \n Many never returned home, being killed during service or dying years later in foreign lands. \n ‚ÄúThere are remains in Japan, Polynesia, Papua New Guinea, Sakhalin and Saipan. In Sakhalin alone, there are tens of thousands of remains (of conscripted Korean labourers),‚Äù Park said. \n Koreans who were conscripted as labourers for Japanese companies and worked abroad under greuelling conditions have only now started to gain legal recognition of their rights to compensation. \n On July 10, the Seoul High Court ruled in favour of four Korean victims of forced labour and ordered Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp. to pay 100 million won (US8,000) to each plaintiff. \n Tree weeks later, the Busan High Court made a similar ruling against Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, ordering the Japanese company to pay 80 million won to each of the five forced labourers. \n However, Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal have already appealed, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is expected to follow suit. \n One agreement, different views \n Japanese entities, both public and private, have ignored Korean victims‚Äô claims, arguing that the 1965 Korea-Japan Claims Settlement Agreement covers all related issues including conscripted labourers and comfort women. \n Comfort women are women of various nationalities, mainly Korean, who were forced to serve as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers in the first half of the 20th century. Despite evidence to the contrary, Japan has maintained for decades that the comfort women were never forced by the state into sexual slavery.\n Japanese courts have thrown out numerous suits filed by Koreans seeking compensation on the grounds that Japan‚Äôs responsibilities were fulfilled by the agreement.\n However, Korean activists, lawyers and even some Japanese legal professionals have argued that the individuals‚Äô right to claims remain intact, saying that the Korean government was not authorised to be their proxy in conducting the negotiations. \n Although the Korean authorities had held the view that the 1965 agreement nullified the individuals‚Äô right to claims, this opinion has shifted in recent years. \n ‚ÄúIndividuals‚Äô right to claims should be considered to exist. In the past, both Korea and Japan said that the right didn‚Äôt exist. Then both agreed that the rights did exist, but Japan has gone back to denying it,‚Äù said Kim Young-won, the Ministry of Foreign Affair‚Äôs special ambassador for issues concerning the Korea-Japan Claims Settlement Agreement.\n He added that after a Constitutional Court‚Äôs ruling regarding comfort women, the Korean government had attempted to engage Japan to discuss related issues, but to no avail. \n In 2011, the Constitutional Court ruled that the Korean government had failed to make all diplomatic efforts to obtain compensation for the comfort women, and that the government violated their basic rights through its lack of action. \n Kim also warned of repercussions related to recent rulings from Seoul and Busan courts. \n ‚ÄúJapan could argue that we are defaulting on a treaty as the interpretation (of the situation) has changed since 2005,‚Äù Kim said. \n In 2005, a study conducted under the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office concluded that the 1965 agreement covered victims of Japan‚Äôs colonial rule with the exception of those sent to Sakhalin, comfort women and those who were affected by the nuclear bombing of Japan.\n Jumble of records buried in time \n However, Japan has not always held its current position. \n Recently revealed records show that the Japanese government had the intention to compensate those forced into labour individually and to treat their right to claim separately from that of Korea.\n In April, Choi Bong-tae, a lawyer who is leading the suit against the Japanese government, revealed a partial record of the Korea-Japan negotiations in 1961 showing that Hayato Ikeda, the Japanese prime minister at the time, suggested such measures to former President Park Chung-hee. \n The negotiations as a whole lasted 13 years, from 1952 to 1965. \n In the document, Ikeda is quoted as saying that his government was willing to apply the same standards it was using to compensate Japanese nationals to Korean victims.\n Ikeda is also on record as saying that his government would consider providing pension and consolation payments to those who had returned to Korea. \n However, all such measures were excluded from the final agreement reached in 1965. Instead, Korea received $500 million ‚Äï $300 million of which was a free grant ‚Äï from the Japanese government and $200 million in loans from Japan‚Äôs private sector. \n ‚ÄúOur government sold the people out. In 2005, documents were disclosed in Korea and it showed that the government requested $200 for every survivor, $1,650 for each person who died and $2,000 for each one who was injured,‚Äù Choi said. \n However, Choi believes the full records, which Japan has refused to disclose, will tell a different story. \n ‚ÄúJapan will not disclose the parts (that contain the Korean government‚Äôs response). If those parts are disclosed, the fact that the money they provided in 1965 was not for conscription victims will be made clear,‚Äù Choi said. \n ‚ÄúI suspect that if those parts are revealed, it will show that Japan told (the Korean government) not to give that money to the victims.‚Äù \n ‚ÄúDiplomatic records are usually made public after 30 years. It has been 50 years (since the negotiations), and the fact that they (Japanese government) are unwilling to open the records even today proves that they know just how much wrong they did,‚Äù Choi said. He added that the reason Japan was keeping the remainder of the documents secret was that the records would prove that the victims had not been compensated, which would in turn lead to huge costs.\n ‚ÄúRevealing documents doesn‚Äôt require money. What is needed now is not money, but the courage to look at the truth.‚Äù \n Lasting anguish \n Although the Korean government began laying the legal basis for compensating the victims and their families in 1966, the first payment was not made until 1975.\n Even when the payments were made, only a fraction of the victims were able to receive amounts far smaller than what the Korean government demanded from Japan. \n Between 1975 and 1977, families of 8,552 Koreans who died abroad under forced labour each received 300,000 won.\n By the won-dollar exchange rate of the time, 300,000 won was worth about $622, only about one-third of the $1,650 the government received from Japan for each Korean who died in its service. \n The actions taken by the Korean government at the time continue to anger those who survived forced labour and the families of the deceased victims nearly 50 years on. \n ‚ÄúWe will take it to the end. A few others and I are also preparing suits against the Korean government,‚Äù said Lee Ju-seon, the head of an association of victims‚Äô families. \n Lee, whose father died in the South Pacific after he was conscripted into the Japanese navy, says he feels ‚Äúindescribable injustice.‚Äù \n ‚ÄúThe Park Chung-hee government received compensation (from Japan), but we have not seen a penny of it. How can this be?‚Äù \n *US$1=1,111 won","The matter of compensation for Koreans conscripted into forced labour by Japan remains unresolved\nNearly seven decades after the Korean Peninsula was liberated from Japan‚Äôs colonial rule, the matter of Tokyo‚Äôs compensation for Koreans conscripted into forced labour and military service remains unresolved.\n‚ÄúSome academics estimate that as many as 2 million Koreans were conscripted as soldiers and support staff for the Japanese military and as labourers,‚Äù said Park In-hwan, chief of the Commission on Verification and Support for the Victims of Forced Mobilisation under Japanese Colonialism of Korea.\nKoreans who were conscripted as labourers for Japanese companies and worked abroad under greuelling conditions have only now started to gain legal recognition of their rights to compensation.\nOn July 10, the Seoul High Court ruled in favour of four Korean victims of forced labour and ordered Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp.\nTree weeks later, the Busan High Court made a similar ruling against Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, ordering the Japanese company to pay 80 million won to each of the five forced labourers.\nJapanese entities, both public and private, have ignored Korean victims‚Äô claims, arguing that the 1965 Korea-Japan Claims Settlement Agreement covers all related issues including conscripted labourers and comfort women.\nHowever, Korean activists, lawyers and even some Japanese legal professionals have argued that the individuals‚Äô right to claims remain intact, saying that the Korean government was not authorised to be their proxy in conducting the negotiations.\nThen both agreed that the rights did exist, but Japan has gone back to denying it,‚Äù said Kim Young-won, the Ministry of Foreign Affair‚Äôs special ambassador for issues concerning the Korea-Japan Claims Settlement Agreement.\nHe added that after a Constitutional Court‚Äôs ruling regarding comfort women, the Korean government had attempted to engage Japan to discuss related issues, but to no avail.\nIn 2005, a study conducted under the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office concluded that the 1965 agreement covered victims of Japan‚Äôs colonial rule with the exception of those sent to Sakhalin, comfort women and those who were affected by the nuclear bombing of Japan.\nRecently revealed records show that the Japanese government had the intention to compensate those forced into labour individually and to treat their right to claim separately from that of Korea.\nIn April, Choi Bong-tae, a lawyer who is leading the suit against the Japanese government, revealed a partial record of the Korea-Japan negotiations in 1961 showing that Hayato Ikeda, the Japanese prime minister at the time, suggested such measures to former President Park Chung-hee.\nIn the document, Ikeda is quoted as saying that his government was willing to apply the same standards it was using to compensate Japanese nationals to Korean victims.\nIf those parts are disclosed, the fact that the money they provided in 1965 was not for conscription victims will be made clear,‚Äù Choi said.\n‚ÄúI suspect that if those parts are revealed, it will show that Japan told (the Korean government) not to give that money to the victims.‚Äù \nIt has been 50 years (since the negotiations), and the fact that they (Japanese government) are unwilling to open the records even today proves that they know just how much wrong they did,‚Äù Choi said.\nBetween 1975 and 1977, families of 8,552 Koreans who died abroad under forced labour each received 300,000 won.\nThe actions taken by the Korean government at the time continue to anger those who survived forced labour and the families of the deceased victims nearly 50 years on.",Korea,South Korea,United_States,Seoul,Article,"Tokyo, Japan",China,Forced Criminality,Sexual Servitude

He is one of the most notorious wildlife criminals in the country.‚Äù‚ÄúWe sincerely hope there will be no influence peddling or attempts to corrupt the process, and that this time he is severely punished,‚Äù Mathot added.As he has already been sentenced for wildlife trafficking, if convicted, Rodrigue faces up to a year in prison and a CFA 20 million (USD 40‚Äô400; Euro 30‚Äô500) fine.In comparison, on Tuesday in neighboring Republic of Congo, two wildlife traffickers were sentenced to five years in jail for the same crime. Repeat offenders there also see their sentence double.Bas Huijbregts, the Central African head of WWF‚Äôs campaign against illegal wildlife trade, also encouraged Gabon to jail Rodrigue, but also to toughen its anti-poaching and anti-trafficking laws.‚ÄúOver the past few years, Gabon has consistently shown itself to be a leader in the battle against wildlife criminality. But its wildlife laws are not stringent enough,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúThe country is preparing to put in place some of the toughest laws in the region against wildlife criminality, creating the legal deterrent needed to stop ivory traffickers.‚Äù‚ÄúWe urge it to do so as soon as possible,‚Äù Huijbregts added.Rising demand for ivory ‚Äì especially in East and South East Asia ‚Äì has led to an epidemic of poaching in Congo Basin.

Huang said the first batch of hospitals -- he didn't say how many -- will end the practice of using prisoners' organs following a meeting on the issue this November.\n\nAbout 300,000 patients are wait-listed each year for an organ in China. Only one in 30 will receive a transplant.\n\nVoluntary donations remain low because many Chinese people follow beliefs that oppose organ removal before burial. Huang said in 2010 there were only 63 cases of voluntary organ donation. This year, the country has averaged 130 donations per month, but it's still not nearly enough to meet demand.\n\nThere is also a widespread belief in China that using organ donations from prisoners on death row allows the inmates to redeem themselves for their crimes, Reuters reported. China says it is only done with the prisoners' consent. But human rights groups have long been outraged by the practice, and say there's evidence that organs are harvested without consent -- and worse, sometimes when the donor is still alive.\n\nMeng Zhaoping, a mother of an executed prisoner, sought answers in February 2009 for her son's death. She told the Associated Press that she never received the reason why he was executed, nor did she get his remains. She believed that officials had harvested his organs before disposing of his body.\n\nThough Chinese officials had also said in 2007 that they would stop using organs from prisoners, China Daily reported in 2009 that 65 percent of the country's organ donations still came from convicts. The volunteer donor system was established that same year.\n\nThe numbers improved only slightly since then: Huang said that at the end of 2012 about 64 percent of organs transplanted in China came from prisoners. So far this year, the number is at 54 percent.\n\nThe China Organ Transplant Committee began in 25 provinces and municipalities. About 1,000 organs have been donated, and 3,000 patients have been helped, Huang said.

As they cannot pay outright, they are threatened with violence on arrival and forced to work for minimal wages, until the debt is repaid.\n\nThis form of modern slavery can endure for years, as the discrepancy between the 'debt' and the money paid to these people is so great.\n\n\n\nThere are around 30,000 nail bars in Britain, and police have raided around 100 of them since 2008. Nail bar owners have been fined almost ¬£700,000 for employing 150 illegal immigrants.\n\n\n\nLondon, Manchester and Portsmouth are particular hotspots for the problem. Police admit they have no idea how many trafficked workers there are in the industry - but fear the number is far higher than 150.\n\nAccording to the International Labour Organisation, human traffickers make around ¬£21bn from the people smuggling business, and around 21 million people are trapped in forced labour worldwide.\n\nIn a sign that the British state is waking up to the problem, the sum allocated to the Government-funded support scheme for victims of trafficking has doubled in the past year, to ¬£3m.\n\n\n\nYears of slavery: Trafficking victims are obliged to work for years on end because the sum they owe is so high, and their wages are so low\n\nOne trafficking victim, 28-year-old Mi Duc Li [name changed] recently told Northampton Crown Court how he was forced to work in a nail bar in the Midlands to pay off the ¬£23,000 cost of his travel to Britain.\n\nAppearing as a prosecution witness against alleged 'slave master' Hanh Van Vu, he told how he escaped after seven years and threw himself on the mercy of the police.\n\nLi says he agreed to come to the UK on the promise of high earnings. After using fake travel documents to get through Vietnamese immigration, he destroyed them on the plane and told officials at Heathrow airport he was a refugee.\n\n\n\nUsing a false name, Li repeated a lie concocted by his traffickers - claiming he had been tortured for protesting against Vietnam's communist government.\n\n\n\nWhen questioning officials failed to penetrate his story, Li was allowed into the UK without any further interrogation. He was sent to a nail bar in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire - and given just one day off every two months.\n\n\n\n'I was rarely paid and if I was, Vu took money each time for bringing me to the country,' he says.\n\nVu was ultimately sentenced to 11 years' imprisonment on charges related to human trafficking.\n\nBroken dreams: Manicurists in Vietnam are told they can earn their ¬£150 training fee back in the UK in just a few hours\n\nThough Li Tan has escaped the traffickers' clutches, he fears many young men and women like him are waiting to take his place. In his hometown, Haiphong, nail academies charge wannabe manicurists ¬£150 for a six-month course, telling them they can earn the same in just hours in Britain.\n\nThe Sunday Times, which investigated the trafficking of Vietnamese nationals to UK nail bars, cites figures from two of Britain's biggest nail-product suppliers, who claim there are 100,000 Vietnamese manicurists working in British nail salons. Worryingly, census data points to just 29,000 Vietnamese-born people officially living in Britain.\n\nBack in Vietnam, the British embassy has launched a pilot scheme to give business loans and training to 36 trafficking victims who were returned to Vietnam from Britain, in a bid to help them put their lives back on track.","The slave trade of British nail bars: How victims of human trafficking from Vietnam are exploited in beauty salons and forced into prostitutionVietnamese migrants are propping up Britain's beauty industry after being put to work as slaves in nail bars, police have claimed.\nOnce here, the victims - mostly women - are controlled by people traffickers, and many are forced into prostitution.\nAs they cannot pay outright, they are threatened with violence on arrival and forced to work for minimal wages, until the debt is repaid.\nThere are around 30,000 nail bars in Britain, and police have raided around 100 of them since 2008.\nThe Sunday Times, which investigated the trafficking of Vietnamese nationals to UK nail bars, cites figures from two of Britain's biggest nail-product suppliers, who claim there are 100,000 Vietnamese manicurists working in British nail salons.",Slavery,Human trafficking,Manchester,Portsmouth,Incident,"London, Greater London, England, United Kingdom","Manchester, England, United Kingdom",Forced Criminality,Health/Beauty Services

Among those receiving a royal reprieve was 63-year-old Spanish national Daniel Galvan, who had served just one-and-a-half years of a 30 year jail sentence for the rape of 11 children.\n\nProtests against King Mohamed‚Äôs decision erupted almost immediately, forcing him to reverse and publicly justify a pardon for the first time and revealing a large degree of disquiet among the Moroccan public over the powers the monarchy continues to wield.\n\nAnalysts say this political crisis is a watershed for the regime, the possible birth of public movement to question the King‚Äôs actions. Never before had a royal decision led to such anger. In a statement issued by the royal palace on Aug. 4, he said he was not aware of Galvan‚Äôs criminal record and promised an investigation into what has come to be called here ‚ÄúDanielgate.‚Äù\n\nAfter a surprisingly quick investigation Hafid Benhachem, the head of Morocco‚Äôs prisons and close to retirement, was sacked. An international arrest warrant was issued and Galvan was arrested last Monday in Murcia in the southeast of Spain.\n\nAccording to the newspaper Lakome, two lists of Spanish prisoners were merged. In the first one, 18 were supposed to be granted pardons, while 30 others on a second list were only to be extradited. In the end, 48 prisoners were released.\n\nAs soon as the news that Galvan had been released spread on July 31, thousands of people answered a call to protest on Facebook. In front of Morocco‚Äôs parliament in Rabat, on August 2nd, protesters were violently dispersed and dozens were injured, including several journalists.\n\nPeople power?\n\nThis initiative was taken by ordinary citizens from different backgrounds, among them artists, intellectuals, human rights advocates, activists, and tech-savvy youths. Many were protesting for the first time.Moroccans also took to the streets in Agadir, and in Kenitra, the town where Galvan had lived. In Tangiers, T√©touan and Nador, police also intervened.Police repression of the protests, widely covered by the international media, sparked further outrage.\n\nEven after the king‚Äôs explanation, lauded by many Moroccans, protests continued in Rabat and Casablanca, Morocco‚Äôs business capital. Their goal was not only to continue to denounce this pardon but also to demand an independent judiciary. They also asked for the king to present an apology.\n\n‚ÄúLong live the people,‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is a shame,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou put a shame on us, You sold us to Spain,‚Äù they chanted, addressing the king. Some also asked for the resignation of the king‚Äôs close advisor Fouad Ali El Himma.Zineb, a woman in her twenties, attended the Casablanca gathering last Tuesday with her father, who was protesting for the first time.

The commission and aid agencies are also worried that orphaned and vulnerable children may be falling prey to traffickers.\n\n""The risk of children falling prey to traffickers is always there after a natural calamity, especially of this magnitude,"" Ajay Sethia, chairperson of the Uttarakhand State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, told IANS. ""My concern is how to handle the more than 300-400 orphaned children because the government has no infrastructure.""\n\nFlash floods and landslides caused by cloudbursts claimed thousands of lives in Uttarakhand in June. Among those killed and affected were both pilgrims and locals. As a result, families have been torn apart, some being entirely washed away, others leaving only a few survivors and orphaned children.\n\nQuoting the latest state government figures, Sethia said that as of now, 287 children from other states - mostly pilgrims' children - have been reported to have gone missing after the tragedy. The most among these missing children - 130 - were from Uttar Pradesh. Others were from Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Chandigarh.\n\n""The district administration figures of children of local people going missing is 168, but the commission believes the figure is higher,"" Sethiya said. ""For instance, in Rudraprayag district, the official estimate of missing children is 146, but the commission's figure is 181. So our total figure is 203 missing children, but there may be more.""\n\nKailash Satyarthi of the Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) said that the focus of the government has not yet reached the children, which is a matter of concern.\n\n""The focus was on rescuing the missing people, the pilgrims first because they were in such big numbers and then the locals. Children have still not got the focus, which is worrying, because from our experience, after every natural disaster a place becomes a trafficking zone. We had seen it during and after the Kosi floods, during the Tsunami, and now we fear the same in Uttarakhand.""\n\nThe Uttarakhand SCPCR pushed the central government to start the Integrated Child Protection Scheme in the state under which all existing child protection schemes, with additional interventions, will be brought together to build a protective environment for children.\n\n""The central government will allot the funds and we have given directions for the care of vulnerable children and orphans. We have said that of the 13 observation homes, only three should remain and the rest should be made children's homes. In Tehri, there is one shelter home which should be converted into a children's home,"" Sethia said.\n\nAlthough no case of trafficking or kidnapping has been reported till now, recognising the looming threat on vulnerable children, Sethia said, he had instructed the director general of police to activate the four anti-trafficking units in the state.\n\nCivil society, on the other hand, has been doing its bit to offer a protective environment to the affected children. Save the Children India, for instance, has plans of building 100 child-friendly spaces in as many villages in which trained caregivers will help children learn, play, get medical help and interact with one another for psycho-social support.\n\n""Children are at a loose end and unprotected, either because their families have disappeared or they are left alone because their parents have gone looking for alternative livelihood. Schools have been washed away and the kids are extremely traumatised. In such a scenario, these child-friendly spaces, which are tented areas, aim to provide support,"" Devendra Tak of the NGO told IANS.\n\nOf the 100 planned, 13 such spaces in three districts - Chamoli, Uttarkashi and Tehri Garhwal - are functional and support 25-30 children each, although their capacity is 50 each. The initiative has the support of both the state government and the Centre.\n\nSatyarthi further said that BBA has written to the Uttarakhand government to instruct the local police to prevent outsiders from entering the 2,000 affected villages without verification.\n\n""It's very easy to lure away children from parents on the pretext of a job in a city and a good livelihood when they have lost everything. Traffickers will be on the lookout for such vulnerable families to source child labourers,"" he warned.\n\n(Azera Rahman can be contacted at azera.rahman@gmail.com)\n\nFind latest and upcoming tech gadgets online on Tech2 Gadgets.

Her baby boy was born alive and died in her arms.\n\nShe said she felt ‚Äúas if I were a pig waiting to be slaughtered,‚Äù according to human rights activist Reggie Littlejohn of the U.S.-based Women‚Äôs Rights Without Frontiers.\n\nLittlejohn told LifeNews that, after repeated requests to the Family Planning Office for an explanation, Zeng reportedly received a lengthy communication from a Family Planning Officer stating that she had been forcibly aborted at the request of her ex-husband‚Äôs first wife, with whom he has a son. Her ex-husband (assumed to be her husband at the time), signed the consent form for the forced abortion. According to the report, the Family Planning Officer told Zeng:\n\nIf you want to blame someone, please blame the [One-Child] Policy, or your husband. If he had not agreed to sign the form, no doctor would have dared to inject the induced labor needle into your body. Lili Zeng . . . if you continue to send text messages or call to berate me, I will definitely find someone to deal with you.\n\nLittlejohn said Zeng stated that she has attempted suicide three times since the forced abortion. Although the forced abortion occurred in 2011, Zeng has broken her silence only now in an attempt to seek justice.\n\n‚ÄúOur hearts break for Ms. Zeng, who has endured forced abortion at nine months and whose baby died in her arms,‚Äù Littlejohn said. ‚ÄúHer experience dramatically demonstrates the connection between forced abortion and China‚Äôs astronomical female suicide rate: 590 women a day end their lives in China.‚Äù\n\nLittlejohn continued: ‚ÄúHer experience shows that full-term babies born alive after a botched forced abortion may be left to die. Her experience also shows that a woman can be forcibly aborted up to the ninth month of pregnancy with the consent of her presumed husband. Finally, Ms. Zeng‚Äôs experience shows that ‚Äì even when a woman is pregnant with her first child ‚Äì if it is her husband‚Äôs second child, she can be forcibly aborted.

5e8233760dc171d3c93e7bd5,http://www.concordmonitor.com/home/8128531-95/an-important-and-serious-look-at-human-trafficking,An important and serious look at human trafficking,"An important and serious look at human trafficking\n\nBy JOHN TIRMAN\n\nFor the Washington Post\n\nLast modified: 8/25/2013 12:37:01 AM\n\nHuman trafficking is one of those issues that rankle people even when they don‚Äôt understand its actual shape and scope. At least a dozen books have appeared in the past few years describing the horrors of sex trafficking, a gruesome practice of enslavement and perversion affecting millions of (mostly) girls the world over, including, with alarming frequency, in the United States. But as Stephanie Hepburn and Rita J. Simon point out in their encyclopedic study of global trafficking, the larger crime is forced-labor trafficking, which is three times greater than that for sex commerce. The official response to each is inadequate ‚Äì under-resourced, legally fragile and too often complicit.\n\n\n\nThe scale of these crimes is staggering. ‚ÄúAs of 2005 this global phenomenon reaped an annual worldwide profit of $44.3 billion and affected more than 12.3 million persons,‚Äù the authors write. About half are children.\n\n\n\nOther forms of trafficking are rampant ‚Äì human organs, most prominently ‚Äì but forced labor accounts for two-thirds of the cases. Victims are often recruited with promises of jobs abroad or within their own countries, but once in the grip of the traffickers they are essentially slaves. Various forms of subjugation are involved, such as debt bondage resulting from exorbitant ‚Äúfees‚Äù for transportation, food and housing, but it all amounts to a system of violently enforced servitude from which escape is only a remote possibility.\n\n\n\nWhile the common perception of trafficking tends to focus on sexual exploitation in places like Thailand and Dubai, the United States is among the top 10 destinations. Thousands of victims are brought into America each year from all over the world. They are used mainly for household labor, agriculture, food and care services, and in the garment industry.\n\n\n\nThose in industry are housed in substandard quarters and do not get paid, or owe so much because of the traffickers‚Äô ‚Äúfees‚Äù that payment is irrelevant.\n\n\n\nSex trafficking to the United States is estimated to bring 50,000 women and girls to our shores each year, mainly for prostitution. The authors cite a case of Mexican women trafficked to Florida to work, they thought, as maids or waitresses.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúUpon arrival in the United States, the traffickers raped the women and girls, confiscated their travel documents, and forced them to prostitute. Guards prevented them from leaving the brothels, and if the victims tried to escape they faced severe physical punishment as well as threats of deportation.‚Äù\n\n\n\nForced labor follows similar patterns the world over. Hepburn and Simon march the reader through 23 countries, including several in Europe, to illustrate different dimensions of the problem. This is not just a pathology of ‚ÄúNinotchkas‚Äù from post-Soviet Russia or sex-crazed sheiks or sex tourists in Bangkok. This is an enormous enterprise that touches every corner of the globe.\n\n\n\nMost disquieting is how laws in many countries are used against trafficking victims. For example, in Italy, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, laborers brought in illegally, under duress, can be put in detention, fined and deported as illegal immigrants. Time and again, the authors explain, trafficking victims are charged and sometimes jailed for prostitution or using false papers, among other lawbreaking.\n\n\n\nIn India (and elsewhere), the law enforcement system is so deplorable when it comes to prosecuting traffickers that it‚Äôs the rare case that makes it to a conviction. The authors recount that ‚Äúa rescued victim from Nepal was repeatedly deposed and continually asked embarrassing questions in an attempt to get her to withdraw the charges.‚Äù\n\n\n\nLaws are changing, and some judicial and police practices are improving, but the pace is slow and incommensurate with the scale of the crimes.\n\n\n\nHepburn and Simon, lawyers associated with American University, parse the different causes and sources of human chattel ‚Äì desperate poverty is the font of vulnerability, of course, but conflict-riddled countries are particularly prone to exploitation.\n\n\n\nIn Iraq after the U.S. invasion, contractor immunity granted by U.S. officials in effect gave permission for the abuse of workers, who were imported from many of the same countries we see with large guest-worker programs: Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and so on. Reconstruction and the promise of good wages drew many workers who were then diverted to household servitude or worse.\n\n\n\nWomen in Iraq are ‚Äúparticularly vulnerable to a variety of crimes such as kidnapping, sexual assault, and human trafficking. One trafficking ring sold 128 Iraqi women to Saudi Arabia in 2008 and 2009. The ring was made up of Iraqi police officers, members of the Governorate‚Äôs Council . . . and security officials.‚Äù Poor families are preyed upon by syndicates pretending to be adoption agencies or nongovernmental organizations that will take their children to better lives, only to sell them into slavery or the sex trade, or as child soldiers.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúI did anything possible to keep them with me,‚Äù a woman who sold two of her children explained, ‚Äúbut I lost my husband while I was pregnant with my fifth child and life became too hard.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe Iraqi government estimates that there are at least 900,000 widows in Iraq, and poverty among them is high.\n\n\n\nThroughout this grim account, the authors only rarely let emotions slip through. The book reads like a policy document, sometimes a legal one, organized identically in each chapter. Statistics abound. This is a bit off-putting but nonetheless valuable. It‚Äôs a good companion to the 2010 book by Louise Shelley, Human Trafficking: A Global Perspective, which emphasizes the role of transnational organized crime.","An important and serious look at human traffickingBy JOHN TIRMANFor the Washington PostLast modified: 8/25/2013 12:37:01 AMHuman trafficking is one of those issues that rankle people even when they don‚Äôt understand its actual shape and scope.\nSex trafficking to the United States is estimated to bring 50,000 women and girls to our shores each year, mainly for prostitution.\nTime and again, the authors explain, trafficking victims are charged and sometimes jailed for prostitution or using false papers, among other lawbreaking.\nWomen in Iraq are ‚Äúparticularly vulnerable to a variety of crimes such as kidnapping, sexual assault, and human trafficking.\nIt‚Äôs a good companion to the 2010 book by Louise Shelley, Human Trafficking: A Global Perspective, which emphasizes the role of transnational organized crime.",Prostitution,Human trafficking,Pakistan,Philippines,Incident,United Kingdom,Nepal,Child Trafficking,Illicit Activities

The group rated states on 10 categories of laws that combat human trafficking, punish traffickers and support survivors.\nThe states were ranked into four tiers. Those with laws covering more of the 10 categories are in Tiers 1 or 2. South Dakota is the only Tier 4 state, which is the worst ranking.\nColorado has laws covering four of the 10 categories, making it one of the six Tier 3 states. \nBut Amanda Finger, co-founder of the Denver-based Laboratory to Combat Human Trafficking, said there were some oversights in the report.\n""I don't think their report really takes in the nuances of Colorado laws or the human trafficking responses that are in effect already,"" she said. ""In general, I don't think one-size-fits-all can work for all the states.""\n Polaris officials stressed the importance of blanket federal laws in combating trafficking and assuring victims are treated as such rather than criminalized. \n ""We need to see strong federal laws in place,"" Polaris Project CEO Bradley Myles said during a Wednesday conference call. \nFinger said if that becomes a reality, those trafficking laws must not jeopardize laws and systems already proven effective.\n""Our child protection laws are already some of the strongest in the country,"" Finger said.

They do not deserve to have children.'\n\nCHILD BRIDES: A GLOBAL ISSUE\n\n\n\nDespite numerous campaigns from many of the world's largest charities and NGOs, the issue of child brides remains a global concern. There are currently some 57.5 million child brides across the world, 40 per cent of which married in India. Forty-six per cent of women in India were married before the age of 18, according to the National Family Health Survey-3.\n\nMeanwhile, in Africa, 42 per cent of girls were married before turning 18 compared to 29 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nBut the number of child brides is estimated to rise to 140 million by 2020 if current trends continue, 18.5 million of which will be under 15 years old , analysts warn. Statistics show that girls living in poor households are almost twice as likely to marry before 18 than girls in higher income households. And girls younger than 15 are also five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their 20s.\n\n\n\nBut another blogger, called 'Sad', appeared more sympathetic to the custom. He wrote: 'Her family and her groom could have waited for some time before having this marriage,' Sad said.\n\n'It was not fair at all and the marriage should not have happened even if some tribes believe that it is a good custom.'\n\n\n\nThe practice of marrying young girls is widespread in Yemen and has attracted the attention of international rights groups seeking to pressure the government to outlaw child marriages.\n\nYemen's gripping poverty plays a role in hindering efforts to stamp out the practice, as poor families find themselves unable to say no to 'bride-prices' that can be hundreds of dollars for their daughters.\n\n\n\nMore than a quarter of Yemen's females marry before age 15, according to a report in 2010 by the Social Affairs Ministry.\n\n\n\nTribal custom also plays a role, including the belief that a young bride can be shaped into an obedient wife, bear more children and be kept away from temptation.\n\n\n\nIn September 2010, a 12-year-old Yemeni child-bride died after struggling for three days in labour to give birth, a local human rights organisation said.\n\n\n\nYemen once set 15 as the minimum age for marriage, but parliament annulled that law in the 1990s, saying parents should decide when a daughter marries.","The girl, identified only as Rawan, died in the tribal area of Hardh in northwestern Yemen, which borders Saudi Arabia.\nThere are currently some 57.5 million child brides across the world, 40 per cent of which married in India.\nMeanwhile, in Africa, 42 per cent of girls were married before turning 18 compared to 29 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nHe wrote: 'Her family and her groom could have waited for some time before having this marriage,' Sad said.\nThe practice of marrying young girls is widespread in Yemen and has attracted the attention of international rights groups seeking to pressure the government to outlaw child marriages.",Marriage,Saudi Arabia,Latin America,Africa,Article,Saudi Arabia,Yemen,Child Labour,Child Marriage

But we work for our rights. That‚Äôs the difference,‚Äù said Danuwar, who is the organization‚Äôs president and one of its founders.\n\n‚ÄúThe feelings and difficulties of survivors can only be understood by survivors themselves. No other person can feel how we feel,‚Äù said Puri, treasurer of this top Nepalese antitrafficking group.\n\nRescued from brothels\n\nBoth Puri and Danuwar were among the 300 other Nepali girls rescued in a massive police raid of Indian brothels in 1996. But though the rescue freed them from their abusers, they found themselvs ‚Äúkept in harsh semidetention‚Äù for months as their repatriation suffered delays, according to the Ramon Magsaysay Awards Foundation (RMAF).\n\nNothing changed once they were back in their homeland, as both the government and their families disowned them, seeing them as ‚Äúsoiled women.‚Äù It was then that the women realized they had no one to turn to but themselves.\n\nFit for ‚Äòeasy jobs‚Äô only\n\nThe survivors, aged 15 to 18 at the time, decided to form themselves into Shakti Samuha, a ‚Äúpower group‚Äù reaching within themselves to overcome the systemic stigma on trafficked women and start their lives anew.\n\nInitially, their government did not appreciate the intrepid move. Recalled Danuwar: ‚ÄúIn the beginning, when we tried to register our organization, government people would look at us from head to toe and tell us ‚Äòoh, you are so young, and you don‚Äôt have any education and you are also looking beautiful. So you can go and work in restaurants or massage parlors or find easy jobs.‚Äô‚Äù\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey were denied accreditation at first, but the women were determined to get their government‚Äôs attention. For four years, they lobbied, held survivors‚Äô conferences, spoke in public fora and made the media rounds to talk about their plight.\n\n‚ÄúWe attended our national level forum and said that our government didn‚Äôt give us permission to work in society,‚Äù Danuwar said. ‚ÄúThe survivors also organized survivors‚Äô conferences.‚Äù The pressure eventually compelled the government to accredit the group. In 2000, Shakti Samuha became a full-fledged, state-registered antitrafficking organization, reluctantly recognized by the government.\n\nThe women‚Äôs group now stands as the first nongovernment organization formed and run by trafficking survivors, who are working to make a dent in the multibillion dollar human trafficking industry that persists in many parts of the world, including the Philippines.\n\nSexual slavery\n\nIn Nepal, where the average monthly wage is $71 (P3,000), human trafficking remains a problem, with men, women and children alike trafficked domestically and overseas as forced labor and sexual slaves.\n\nAccording to the 2012 Trafficking in Persons Report of the United States Department of State, the Nepalese government ‚Äúdoes not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking,‚Äù though efforts are underway. The report also cited the complicity of certain government officials with traffickers.\n\n‚ÄúIt is very difficult to fight organized trafficking in Nepal. When Shakti Samuha was formed, it became easier to fight back because we have a team,‚Äù said Puri, who gave a surprised smile when told that her name in Filipino meant ‚Äúdignity.‚Äù\n\nIn the last decade, Shakti Samuha has become Nepal‚Äôs leading organization, pursuing a three-pronged program of ‚Äúrepatriation, rehabilitation and reintegration‚Äù among trafficking victims.\n\nState-funded shelters\n\nThe group is active in 11 Nepalese districts and has 168 members. It has some 500 trafficking victims under its care in state-funded shelters for survivors.\n\nIt has also provided counseling and job placement to at least 678 trafficking victims and livelihood training and education to 670 more. The group has reached some 15,000 Nepalese in programs aimed at spreading awareness of the human trafficking problem among the grassroots sector.\n\nShakti Samuha also managed to pressure the Nepalese government to strengthen its antitrafficking law. Last year, the group scored its first court victory with the conviction of a group of Nepalese traffickers, who are now serving a 117-year jail term.\n\n‚Äú(Things have) changed,‚Äù said Danuwar. ‚ÄúThe government now initiates support for the group and the survivors. When we need help, we ask (government) to rescue victims. Now, it‚Äôs a positive relationship.‚Äù\n\nReclaiming dignity\n\nThe RMAF selected Shakti Samuha as one of this year‚Äôs winners ‚Äúfor transforming their lives in service to other human trafficking survivors, for their passionate dedication toward rooting out a pernicious social evil in Nepal, and the radiant example they have shown the world in reclaiming the human dignity that is the birthright of all abused women and children everywhere.‚Äù\n\nWith the award, the group received a $50,000 grant to take their advocacy further. The group plans to use the money to undertake capacity-building and education programs for survivors and to mount a national-level forum for trafficking victims.\n\nFor trafficking victims, the group has one message: reach out.\n\n‚ÄúIf they are survivors, they are not alone. They could open up to other survivors (and) organizations. People can support them and (help them) deal with trauma and everything [they are going through],‚Äù Danuwar said.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n‚ÄòI always forget that I‚Äôm a woman‚Äô\n\nAfghan woman, Filipino doctor win RM Awards\n\nRead Next\n\nEDITORS' PICK\n\nMOST READ","ADVERTISEMENTThe group organizes survivors of human trafficking who are usually shunned after their ordeal for being ‚Äúsoiled‚Äù women, and provides them state-funded shelters, counseling, education and livelihood training.\nIn 2000, Shakti Samuha became a full-fledged, state-registered antitrafficking organization, reluctantly recognized by the government.\nThe women‚Äôs group now stands as the first nongovernment organization formed and run by trafficking survivors, who are working to make a dent in the multibillion dollar human trafficking industry that persists in many parts of the world, including the Philippines.\nSexual slaveryIn Nepal, where the average monthly wage is $71 (P3,000), human trafficking remains a problem, with men, women and children alike trafficked domestically and overseas as forced labor and sexual slaves.\nThe group has reached some 15,000 Nepalese in programs aimed at spreading awareness of the human trafficking problem among the grassroots sector.",Human trafficking,Slavery,Philippines‚ÄîTwo,Philippines,Incident,Philippines,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",Child Trafficking,Pre-School/Child Day Care Service

(not her real name) sleeps with her newborn baby in a hospital in Kabul. ¬© 2002 Paula Bronstein/Getty Images\n\n(New York) ‚Äì Afghan President Hamid Karzai should take urgent action to fight child marriage and domestic violence or risk further harm to development and public health in Afghanistan, Human Rights Watch said today in a letter to the president.\n\nIn the 15-page briefing paper, ‚ÄúAfghanistan: Ending Child Marriage and Domestic Violence,‚Äù Human Rights Watch highlights the health and economic consequences of marriage under age 18 and violence against women and girls. Karzai, who is barred by term limits from running in the April 2014 presidential election, should make full enforcement of the 2009 Law on the Elimination of Violence Against Women (the EVAW Law) a priority for his last year in office.\n\n‚ÄúPresident Karzai‚Äôs signing of the violence against women law in 2009 ushered in vital protections against child marriage and domestic violence,‚Äù said Liesl Gerntholtz, women‚Äôs rights director at Human Rights Watch. ‚ÄúBy ensuring the law is enforced, Karzai would leave a lasting legacy of support for the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan.‚Äù\n\nThe law imposed tough new penalties for abuse of women, including making child marriage and forced marriage crimes under Afghan law for the first time. Child marriage remains common in Afghanistan, increasing the likelihood of early pregnancy, which heightens the risk of death and injury in childbirth. According to a 2010 mortality survey by the Ministry of Public Health, 53 percent of women in the 25-49 age group were married by the age of 18; 12 percent of Afghan girls aged 15-19 became pregnant or gave birth; and 47 percent of deaths of women aged 20 to 24 were related to pregnancy. It found that one Afghan woman died every two hours because of pregnancy.\n\nChild marriage and early pregnancy also contributes to fistula, a preventable childbirth injury in which prolonged labor creates a hole in the birth canal. A 2011 government report found that 25 percent of the women and girls diagnosed with fistula were younger than 16 when they married and 17 percent were under 16 when they first gave birth. Fistula leaves one leaking urine or feces, and often results in social ostracism, loss of earning capacity, medical expenses for treatment, and depression. Left untreated, fistula can cause further serious medical problems, even death.\n\nChildren born as a result of child marriages also suffer increased health risks. The 2010 mortality survey found a higher death rate among children born to Afghan mothers under age 20 compared to those born to older mothers, which reflects global findings.\n\n‚ÄúAfghan officials should act to end the harm being caused by child marriage,‚Äù said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. ‚ÄúThe damage to young mothers, their children, and Afghan society as a whole is incalculable.‚Äù\n\n\n\nDomestic violence harms individual women and their families and also takes an economic toll on society, including through healthcare costs and lost productivity, Human Rights Watch said. Domestic violence is alarmingly common in Afghanistan: a 2006 study by Global Rights, an international nongovernmental organization, found 85 percent of Afghan women reporting that they had experienced physical, sexual, or psychological violence or forced marriage. An estimated 2,000 Afghan women and girls attempt suicide by setting themselves on fire each year, which is linked to domestic violence and early or forced marriages.\n\nIn the decade since the overthrow of the Taliban government, Afghanistan has failed to take measures adopted by other Islamic countries and countries with large Muslim populations to curtail child marriage and domestic violence, Human Rights Watch said. Bangladesh, Egypt, and Jordan among others have increased the minimum age of marriage to 18. Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Malaysia have introduced legal reforms to combat domestic violence.\n\nAt a donor conference in Tokyo in July 2012, the Afghan government promised to do more to enforce the EVAW law in return for $16 billion in pledges for future aid to Afghanistan. The government should also implement the 2008 Plan of Action for the Advancement of Women adopted by the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The plan of action calls for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, including preventing early and forced marriages, which are considered an impediment to improving the health, education, political participation, social justice, and well-being of women.\n\nHuman Rights Watch urged Karzai to initiate awareness campaigns about the harms of child marriage and domestic violence, and to urgently take the following measures:","In the 15-page briefing paper, ‚ÄúAfghanistan: Ending Child Marriage and Domestic Violence,‚Äù Human Rights Watch highlights the health and economic consequences of marriage under age 18 and violence against women and girls.\n‚ÄúPresident Karzai‚Äôs signing of the violence against women law in 2009 ushered in vital protections against child marriage and domestic violence,‚Äù said Liesl Gerntholtz, women‚Äôs rights director at Human Rights Watch.\nChild marriage remains common in Afghanistan, increasing the likelihood of early pregnancy, which heightens the risk of death and injury in childbirth.\n‚ÄúAfghan officials should act to end the harm being caused by child marriage,‚Äù said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch.\nHuman Rights Watch urged Karzai to initiate awareness campaigns about the harms of child marriage and domestic violence, and to urgently take the following measures:",Hamid Karzai,Afghanistan,Indonesia,Malaysia,Article,"Kabul, Afghanistan","New York, United States",Child Sexual Exploitation,Child Marriage

It's time to end this practice.""\n""I personally have (talked to) the human rights coordinator for the ministry on the ground in Haradh,"" said Mashhour, ""and he informed me that nearly everyone he spoke to is denying the story, but he feels strongly suspicious. We feel people may be hiding information due to fear.""\nCNN spoke with several locals who requested anonymity, as they feared possible reprisals. Many said they'd been ordered to stop discussing the case with the media, insisting officials there were actively downplaying what had happened.\n""No one is talking about this story because its an embarrassment,"" said one resident, ""but this is what poverty can do to people.""\nMany Yemenis say they are forced to sell off their girls to older, wealthier men. \nMohammed Ahmed, head of Haradh's police department, called the reports ""baseless.""\n ""Residents heard this story from one another and it spread very quickly, like a rumor,"" Ahmed said -- adding that Rawan's father had been called into the town's police station for questioning and had denied the incident.\n""When he came to us he brought a little girl with him who he said was Rawan to prove his case, and they were both photographed together by the police,"" Ahmed said. \nYemeni child rights advocate Ahmed Al-Qureshi told CNN he's been investigating the case for more than a week and there's still a lot of confusion surrounding what exactly happened. He's demanding more transparency from officials.\n ""The government is informing us that the Rawan is in their custody and still alive, while other local sources are saying that she was secretly buried,"" said Al-Qureshi, who heads up Seyaj, one of Yemen's leading children's rights groups. \n ""The government is refusing to allow us to visit the girl in their custody,"" he said. ""The evidence we have now cannot prove that Rawan was killed, and that is why we need the government's cooperation."" \n In Yemen, deeply tribal and conservative, the issue of child marriage is an extremely complicated one. According to rights group Human Rights Watch , more than half of all young girls there are married before age 18. About 14% of girls in Yemen are married before age 15.\n In the wake of Rawan's case, the group issued a statement urging Yemen to ""protect its girls from the devastating effects of early marriage by setting 18 as the minimum age for marriage by law.""","Yemen's human rights minister wants child marriage outlawed after an 8-year-old girl reportedly died of internal injuries that she suffered on her wedding night.\nWhen reports emerged last week that a girl named Rawan, from the northern Yemeni town of Haradh, died a few days after being married off to a 40-year-old man, Yemenis were horrified.\nInternational outrage quickly grew, as the alleged incident highlighted once again the extremely controversial issue of child marriage in Yemen -- a country where the practice is still legal.\n""This isn't the first time a child marriage has happened in Yemen, so we should not focus only on this case,"" Mashhour said.\n""I personally have (talked to) the human rights coordinator for the ministry on the ground in Haradh,"" said Mashhour, ""and he informed me that nearly everyone he spoke to is denying the story, but he feels strongly suspicious.\n""Residents heard this story from one another and it spread very quickly, like a rumor,"" Ahmed said -- adding that Rawan's father had been called into the town's police station for questioning and had denied the incident.\nYemeni child rights advocate Ahmed Al-Qureshi told CNN he's been investigating the case for more than a week and there's still a lot of confusion surrounding what exactly happened.\n""The government is informing us that the Rawan is in their custody and still alive, while other local sources are saying that she was secretly buried,"" said Al-Qureshi, who heads up Seyaj, one of Yemen's leading children's rights groups.",Human rights,Marriage,SANAA,Haradh,Incident,Yemen,,Child Marriage,Sexual Servitude

In the last two and half months, the Lankan police seized three boats and detained 300 Sri Lankan nationals, including fifty-six women and ninety-three children.\nThe police officer stressed that they arrested Naval personnel after rescuing seventy-three people from a trawler that was about to leave the island nation for Australia. During interrogation, they revealed that Lieutenant Commander Annatugoda had assured them a safe passage to Australia. Earlier, the police had arrested four Naval officers for the same reason. However, Annatugoda is the most senior one to be arrested in recent months.\nCanberra recently announced that it would transfer all Sri Lankan asylum seekers to neighbouring Papua New Guinea and Nauru, as no one would be allowed to settle in Australia.

Each year as the Ramon Magsaysay awardees are announced, the Filipino people cannot help but miss √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMonching√¢‚Ç¨¬ù. For many he was the greatest president the Philippines ever had, not because he was brilliant or populist, but because he honestly believed in the greatness of the Filipinos.\n\nMy late husband Max recalled in his September 1, 2004 column: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìOne day, I was riding in Matorco, the double-decker bus √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú with the top deck open to the sun √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú which used to cruise up and down Roxas Boulevard.\n\n√¢‚Ç¨≈ìI heard my name being called from below, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMax, Max!√¢‚Ç¨¬ù I looked down, and there was Magsaysay, galloping beside the slow-moving bus on a white horse √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú all by himself. I was so alarmed that I shouted at him: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMr. President √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú Monching √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú for Chrissakes √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú where are your presidential guards?√¢‚Ç¨¬ù\n\n√¢‚Ç¨≈ìHe grinned and shouted back: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThey√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re half a kilometer behind me √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú I outran them!√¢‚Ç¨¬ù (Those were simpler times, when the Presidential Guard Battalion was less motorized and more informal √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú owing to RM√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s own happy-go-lucky example.) I called on the bus driver to stop, and clambered down.\n\n√¢‚Ç¨≈ìMr. President, an entire squadron of HMBS, or even an assassin, could ambush you the way you√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re going around without protection!√¢‚Ç¨¬ù RM laughed and merrily said: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìYou know me well. You√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve gone into the field with me so many times. When it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s your time, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s your time. If it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not, God will protect you.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù\n\nHabiba Sarabi, the only female governor in Afghanistan\n\nThere are few places in the world where the challenge of governance is as daunting and dangerous as in Afghanistan, a country ravaged by warlordism, civil war, and vicious fundamentalism under the Taliban. Afghanistan is embarked today on a perilous process of democratic state-building and development, widespread poverty and illiteracy, and the expected decline in foreign aid with the impending withdrawal of international forces. It is a place and time when true examples of hope are urgently needed.\n\nOne gleaming example is Habiba Sarabi, a 57-year-old doctor and mother of three, who, in a fiercely patriarchal society, is the only female governor in Afghanistan. Sarabi Attended a university in Kabul and studied hematology in India, when the Taliban took power in 1996 and imposed draconian measures on the population, particularly women. Fleeing to Pakistan, she became a teacher and an activist. Organizing together with other Afghan women the Humanitarian Assistance for the Women and Children of Afghanistan (HAWCA), she secretly traveled on foot, back and forth across the mountainous Pakistan-Afghan border, to supervise at great personal risk some 80 underground literacy courses in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2003, Sarabi was appointed to head the Ministry of Women√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Affairs and, in 2005, governor of Bamyan, a poor, agricultural province with a population of half a million. Sarabi vigorously pushed her advocacies for public education and women empowerment. Forty-five percent of the 135,000 school children are female. In 2005, there was only one female police officer; there are now 20, and more women are taking up careers that were forbidden in the Taliban regime.\n\nAs governor, Sarabi has effectively worked with various stakeholders in road construction and other infrastructure projects, agricultural development and improvement of health facilities and health workers. Recognizing Bamyan√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s unique natural, historical, and archeological assets, and their potential for eco-tourism, she pioneered in establishing the 570-kilometer Band-e-Amir National Park, Afghanistan√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s first national park.\n\nSarabi has consistently been assessed by international donor as among the top performers among her peers in local government. In electing Habiba Sarabi to receive the 2013 Ramon Magsaysay Award, the board of trustees recognizes her bold exercise of leadership to build up a functioning local government against great odds.\n\nShakti Samuha, world√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s first anti-trafficking organization created by the survivors themselves\n\nestimates indicate that as many as 10,000 women and children are trafficked annually from Nepal to India for prostitution exploitation. The traffic in persons by means of coercion and deception for commercial sex exploitation, forced labor, or slavery, is an alarming global phenomenon. It plagues a country like Nepal, where poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, and the suppression of women√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s rights in law and tradition, have fueled the problem.\n\nIn 1996, nearly 300 trafficked Nepali girls were rescued in a police raid and in the brothels of Mumbai, India. For six months, they were kept in harsh semi-detention in Mumbai shelters since they could not be immediately repatriated. Nepal√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s government refused to accept them since they were seen as √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsoiled√¢‚Ç¨¬ù female minors, and without citizenship papers. Traumatized, stigmatized and disowned by their families, their prospects of reintegration were difficult and dim. A group of these survivors, however, bravely decided that if society and their own families had abandoned them, then they would have to take control of their lives by themselves. Ages 15 to 18, banded themselves into a group they boldly called Shakti Samuha (√¢‚Ç¨≈ìPower Group√¢‚Ç¨¬ù) √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú with the aim of empowering trafficking survivors so that they can lead a dignified life. They could not register their organization, being minors and √¢‚Ç¨Àúnon-citizens,√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ until 2000. Shakti Samuha is the world√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s first anti-trafficking NGO created and run by trafficking survivors themselves.\n\nIn 2004 the group established Shakti Kendra in Kathmandu, a halfway home that has since provided survivors shelter, medical care, counseling, legal aid, education support, skills training, and start-up loans for income-generating activities. Emergency shelter in Pokhara, offered diverse support services for street children, child laborers, and girls at risk, targeting slums and establishments like dance bars, massage parlors, and carpet factories. Organized community based Child Protection Committees, used such media as street theater in their campaign against trafficking and domestic violence.\n\nPushing the campaign to the policy level, Shakti Samuha partnered with international organizations to develop protocols for repatriation of trafficked victims, significantly influenced the framing of Nepal√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s 2007 Human Trafficking Act and the creation of an anti-trafficking unit in the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare. The 500 trafficked women now constitute its membership. Bonded by a common experience, they are relentless in their drive to help themselves and others like them. As one member declares, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìNowadays, I am ready to fight, to argue and debate against threats and stigmatization. We are trafficking survivors, but no less capable than others in society.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù They have shown the world in reclaiming the human dignity that is the birthright of all abused women and children everywhere.\n\nTurning tears into power\n\nConcluding the Magsaysay Award 2013 presentation ceremony, the Honorable Ma. Lourdes P.A. Sereno, Chief Justice of the Philippines was somewhat embarrassed, for these days the whole country is dismayed over the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìpork barrel√¢‚Ç¨¬ù scandal involving our lawmakers. She noted that the times have called many to higher heroism. How she wished such efforts would be sustainable.\n\nShe especially extoled the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìShakti Samuha√¢‚Ç¨¬ù founders and members for transforming their lives to serve other human trafficking survivors, instead of looking at themselves as victims they converted themselves into fighters willing to offer their lives to protect others. They are not to be blamed. They have √¢‚Ç¨≈ìturned their tears into power.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Their radiant examples have shown the world how to reclaim equality, dignity and self respect.\n\nShe addressed them, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThank you all for being here for us to admire.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù Then she turned to address the audience, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìLaging umasa tayo. Maganda pa rin ang ating kinabukasan.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù (Let√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s keep hoping. We can still look forward to a bright future.)\n\n* * *\n\n(For feedback email at precious.soliven@yahoo.com)","(Part II of Their Courage Set Their People Free √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú Magsaysay Awardees 2013)Ramon Magsaysay√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s fame has far reaching influence among Asians, to rouse their love for country for half a century now.\nEach year as the Ramon Magsaysay awardees are announced, the Filipino people cannot help but miss √¢‚Ç¨≈ìMonching√¢‚Ç¨¬ù.\nOne gleaming example is Habiba Sarabi, a 57-year-old doctor and mother of three, who, in a fiercely patriarchal society, is the only female governor in Afghanistan.\nShakti Samuha is the world√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s first anti-trafficking NGO created and run by trafficking survivors themselves.\nThe 500 trafficked women now constitute its membership.",Taliban,Ramon Magsaysay,Lourdes,British Raj,Article,Philippines,"Kabul, Afghanistan",,Amusement and Recreation
