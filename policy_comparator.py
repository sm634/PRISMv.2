---------

This script takes in a RAG based solution to compare documents (selected to be most relevant to one another) from
different collections. Each collection may represent a Policy such as on Maternity Leave across the UK vs. the EU
for example.

The execution is as follows:
1. Define a set of queries to pass for search (for example, 'what is the maternity pay')
2. Retrieve the relevant chunks or documents have been retrieved from from the separate collections.
3. Compare those chunks to one another, per query and identify similarities and differences using a suitable LLM.
